I feel that Musk‚Äôs statement at the meeting may have a consequence that needs to be paid attention to. He took Tesla and spacex‚Äôs corporate funds and personal assets to allocate a large amount of BTC and did not complete the sell-off at a high level. (Except for the part in the previous announcement), and the cost is about the same as it is now, and Musk said that he will not sell it now, and he may buy it if it continues to fall.

Bitcoin,Another scam the scammer story.,"I saw how much you guys enjoyed [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/oolqdb/today_i_was_able_to_scam_the_scammer_lol/), so thought I'd share my experience of getting a scammer to send me a $27 ""token gift"" several months ago.  


Full story: [https://imgur.com/a/zYjdjdC](https://imgur.com/a/zYjdjdC)  


**Summary:** The scammer is impersonating ""The Bitcoin Rabbi"" but replaces the ""i"" in Rabbi with a ""j."" He supposedly can give you 10x on your investment in 5 days if you join his trading/investment company. I used the ""inspect element"" tool in the browser to create fake screenshots of ""my bitcoin wallet"" to make him believe that I had several bitcoin. I then used the same technique to create a fake conversation between me and another ""investment"" company. I got him to believe this other company offered a ""token gift"" to new investors as a sign of trust. I eventually get the scammer to compete with this other fake company and send me a $27 ""token gift.""

The scammers twitter handle is one letter off from the real Bitcoin Rabbi. The scammer replaced the ""i"" with a ""j"" so after receiving the token gift, I began replacing all ""i' with ""j"" until he figured out what was going. Since he is a Rabbi I also question him about the 7th commandment, ""Thou shall not steal.""",1626924954,grnqrtr,True,1,16,2021-07-22

Bitcoin,How to Invest $1000 Dollars in Crypto? Just Turned 18.,"Hey Bitcoin community, 

As you can gather from the title, I just turned 18 and have accumulated a decent sum of money throughout my years of summer jobs and birthdays. I've been interested in crypto, more specifically Bitcoin, for a few years now. 

I have the fundamental knowledge of crypto but am looking to learn more. My question was concerning what recommendations you all had on how to invest $1000 into various cryptocurrencies? I was thinking about investing half into Bitcoin and the rest into a few other currencies.  I'm not sure how far $1000 can get you in the realm of crypto, but for the moment I believe this is a good starting point. ( Or not?) I am willing to invest more money after I  have a better understanding of crypto. 

Before I close off, what would you guys say is the best crypto exchange for beginner use?

Also, I apologize if this was the wrong place to ask these questions.

Bitcoin,Shower thought I had about a potential source of energy for Bitcoin mining.,"So basically my idea will combine things I watched in 2 separate videos. 

You may want to watch them as well, so you can get what I'm talking about here. It's about 6 minutes of watch time.

English isn't my first language so I may not be able to explain my ideas as clearly as I would like to.

Anyways:

First, I watched this video.

Billions In Change Official Film
https://youtu.be/aqxlWeoa53s

Watch from 14:10 - 18:49


Then I watched this video

The Deepest Hole in the World, And What We've Learned From It

Watch from 2:25 - 2:51


So to summarize. The first video talks about sending Graphene cables down into the earth to be able to extract heat from below  the Earth's surface.

The second video talks about the deepest hole on Earth that goes down 12 km and it gets so hot that they couldn't dig any further because the rocks began to ""act like plastic"".

So there may not even be a need to dig a new hole for energy when one already exists. 

I think Mining companies and Bitcoin billionaires have enough money and resources to explore this idea. 

Manufacturing 12km long graphene cables might be costly but it's a one time expense.

 I think if it can successfully mine Bitcoin profitably over the long term then it does give them the incentive to try it.

I don't have a science or engineering background so this may just be a pipe dream and I'm sure someone more knowledgeable will totally debunk this idea.",1626911932,regretfulfor,True,1,9,2021-07-22

Bitcoin,"With current FUD, don't panic sell. Bitcoin's value will still go to infinity on the long term. Here is why.","During these times, I see a lot of FUD around and newbies are converting their sats back into USD because they fear to lose it all. That‚Äôs unfortunate.

What are the reasons of this sell-off? They treat Bitcoin like risky stocks, get rich quick scheme or worst, they don‚Äôt understand how basic economy works They have no idea that Bitcoin changes everything and will transform our entire society for the better.

As a result, I wanted to emphasize once again why our world needs Bitcoin and reassure everyone that its value is scheduled to go to infinity on the long term.

# 1) We will always want to have more than our neighbors

Since the early ages, humans have always lived in societies to survive and evolve. Social mechanisms have bring the dominance question into the equation: in order to establish our status among our society, we want to have more money than others to show dominance.

Not so long ago, some guys found a new way to distinguish themselves from the masses even more. Their idea was to privately own businesses and make people work for them so they can keep all the profits. It is called capitalism and is still considered the best system nowadays.

# 2) Inflation makes rich richer, while making poor poorer

An interesting lever for our elites to keep earning more is infinite growth. One way to do it is to let banks print new money which will be injected into the economy. Businesses will produce more, people will have more money, making owners wealthier.

However, the more money is printed to support growth, the bigger the money supply gets, and the more prices of goods and services go up. This is inflation. As wages don‚Äôt increase at the same level, employees get less buying power over time, making them poorer.

# 3) Deflation system will never be voted by elites

Remember, governments and business owners will always want to save their privileged status. Stopping money printing, would result in deflation, which means that prices would go down and people stop buying. Why buying something today when it will be cheaper tomorrow?

At that point, companies would go bankrupt, and shareholders would lose their wealth. You know understand how this is important for them to keep inflation running. Quite easy to do : banks simply have to lower loans APR to encourage people to take credits and buy stuffs.

# 4) Inflationary system has plenty of other negative effects

Inflation is also an endless nightmare. Banks or countries borrows money from central banks but their debts will never be paid back. Instead, they take new debts to reimburse part of the old debts. Money printer will never stop. This is actually getting worst over time.

Last but not least, inflation is not a sustainable system for our finite planet. Always-increasing mass consumerism consumes always more energy and resources that are not abundant. Global warming and climate change will never slow down by itself in an inflationist economy.

# 5) Be your own bank with Bitcoin and change the system

To make things clear from the start, Bitcoin is our only hope to change the system. You don‚Äôt know who to vote for at the next elections because you don‚Äôt trust them to bring a working solution? Just buy Bitcoin and hold it. This will be your best vote to have a real impact.

Here are the 5 main reasons why Bitcoin is the only viable solution :

a) Bitcoin is decentralized: it is not governed by anyone and has been designed to follow the exact same principles and will continue to deliver as promised forever. Algorithms embraces certainty. It is the opposite of human-based government that can change rules every now and then to please their own bank account.

b) Bitcoin has a 21M max supply: this is the first time in history we are dealing with an asset that will always be absolutely finite (not even gold), and cannot be replicated. Less and less coin will be produced until 2140, making it the perfect deflationary asset, without mentioning coins that will be lost forever. It is the opposite of central banks which are printing infinite FIAT currencies.

c) Bitcoin is the most secured asset: billions of successful transactions to date and millions of wallets without a single hack to date. The more people join, the more the network is strong and secured. Bitcoin is your secured property as opposed at current systems where banks are hacked every day and could collapse or take your gold in absolute necessity.

d) Bitcoin is the most liquid asset: you are always 1 click away to send any amount to anyone, at any time, and anywhere in the world. Everyone can be its own bank without any government intervention or third party censorship.

e) Bitcoin is the perfect ledger: blockchain technology keeps perfect track of every transaction that has ever happened. You would rather buy your drugs with cash than buying them with Bitcoin. Same principle with corrupted governments in a lot of third countries.

# 6) Bitcoin is a store of value asset above all

As you have probably noticed, and despite what is written on the Bitcoin white paper, I want you to treat Bitcoin like an store of value asset first. The currency/cash feature is just the cherry on top the cake that Satoshi offered to us.

However, as each Bitcoin transaction is considered  a taxable event in many countries, this does not advocate for a currency usage. The high transaction fees are also a challenge that will need to be adressed. There are layer-2 solutions like lightning network that will help in that matter.

# 7) Bitcoin is incentiving holders to think long term

Bitcoin being deflationary, it encourages people to hold their sats on the long term. Nobody wants to sell their bitcoins into a weaker currency that is losing more value over time. Never compare the price of 1 BTC to USD, this is pointless as USD price will go to infinity because of infinite money printing. This is why 1 BTC will always be equal to 1 BTC.

To judge Bitcoin‚Äôs value, think instead on its USD market capitalization and compare it to other scarce asset market caps. Bitcoin still has room to grow 10x its current price to have the same value of gold. 100x to have the same of real estate. If you consider that Bitcoin is scarcer, more secured, and more liquid than these 2 assets, I let you imagine how early we still are.

I hope this summary will help people to realize how important Bitcoin is for our future. It is our escape gate to a fair, inclusive and sustainable world. Buy, hold and spread the word around you!

The market did in fact panic, but I hypothesize that the initial shock was artificially created by a bunch of whales dumping coins into the market to benefit from said shock and buy up later at much lower prices (thus explaining the initial dump right before the crash).

I blame whales for many of the problems and flaws in the crypto market. Without them a lot of ‚Äúprice corrections‚Äù would go out of control as we currently see along with many other problems that would simply disappear or at least be mitigated.

The only good thing we got out of this market crash is that some companies finally started taking care of the whale wallet problem.

Bitcoin,"Elon misunderstands energy use, block size, and block time for Bitcoin. The B Word response.","Elon, the energy cost from bitcoin mining is proportional to its monetary value. Mining is a competition where each participant is incentivized to spend as much money on equipment and electricity as it is profitable. This market will exist for any truly decentralized cryptocurrency. Other cryptos cost less to mine right now because they are worth less, not because they provide more transactions per block. Bitcoin started with just one computer in 2008, using a CPU to process blocks. It could scale back down to that size one day if people stopped valuing it and discontinued mining. The majority of energy used to mine is not spent on processing and recording transactions, it is spent on ‚Äúrolling dice‚Äù for a chance to be the winner of each block and receive the associated transaction fees and block reward. Elon, your affinity for other cryptos with increased block size and block time may be functional for some nodes who have access to gigabyte Ethernet and abundant hard drive space, but that‚Äôs not scalable globally right now. People in many countries cannot afford multiple terabyte hard drives to store the entire blockchain. Currently, Bitcoin requires less than one Terabyte, and that‚Äôs after 10 years of use. The risk of such a change, to faster block times and larger block size is that we could see a choke point emerge with cloud hosting becoming the only way to support and participate in a larger blockchain network, as is the case for E, which relies on Amazon Web Services running Infura. E is not decentralized and will become increasingly political with proof of stake, if they are able to make that transition. The point of bitcoin is to overcome human systems that can be influenced by majority stakeholders, lobbyists, or law makers. Bitcoin is a responsive system that scales up and down, seeking out stranded energy, providing a new way to use excess energy globally.

Bitcoin,"How can we, as a community, reduce the energy consumption of Bitcoin?","I mean, we know, proof of work works very reliable and we are afraid of testing out something different that might endanger the network. But in the end, we use an enormous amount of energy, which no one ever thought was possible.

We have so many brilliant minds in our community. I think we must invent something better that works as reliable as proof of work and is fair (not like proof of stake, where the rich get richer).

Maybe, we can use some hybrid models in the transition phase to not totally loose control when one system fails.

What are the current plans for the future of Bitcoin in terms of energy consumption?

Unfortunately, this is nowadays a very strong counter argument against Bitcoin, which sadly blanks out all the other important properties in nearly every Bitcoin discussion.

Now that obviously wasn‚Äôt me, nor did I authorize anybody to reset my password. I tried to log in with my old password which didn‚Äôt work, so I filled out the forgot my password form and expected an email back with the link to reset my password, but it never came. Tried again a few times but never any email back from Coinbase letting ME reset my email, tho the password was changed from somewhere else this morning. So I further went on to lock my account via phone call, all that needed was that I was calling from the phone number associated with my Coinbase account. I have 2FA set up for my Coinbase account. My question here is, with 2FA set up, if somebody did successfully change my password and try to log in, wouldn‚Äôt it ask for my 2FA,? but since they already got as far as resetting my Coinbase password do they have any shot at having access to my 2FA too,? Or is the 2FA strictly only on my phone.

My only aim was making a quick return so I could buy those lambos!! 

However, once the price peaked out and started to drop and the value of my holding when down and down, in fiat terms. I didn't sell and instead just chose to forget about the investment altogether. A few months later a video about BTC popped up on my recommended youtbe feed. I then remembered that I had some BTC and decided to watch the video. Can't remeber what the video was about specificially but it was interesting enough to make me want to research more about the topic. 

Over the next few weeks and months I then researched as much as I could about BTC, how it worked, what its uses were etc. I also became increasing concerned about the exteremly loose fiscal and monetary policy employeed by western governments and central banks. These two reasons convinced me that I needed to get some more BTC in order to help prepare myself for the future.

I didn't do any crazy trading stragegies or YOLOs, instead I started dollar cost averaging into BTC from early 2019 onwards, not large amounts since I was at university and didn't have much money but as much as I could spare each month. Since then the price has had its ups and downs and occasionally I fall into the habit of thinking in hindsight that I should have bought more there or sold out there but in general I have stopped paying attention to the price and instead focused on getting enough fiat to continue buying BTC!

I think what people can learn from my story is that it doesn't matter when you hear about BTC but how you approach it after you do. Once you do your research on the topic it really does open your eyes to a whole new way of thinking about money, the global economy and of course personal freedom. So to everyone reading this keep on stacking BTC and focus on yourself not the price flucuations!!",1626883482,CoinCollector567,True,1,1,2021-07-22

Bitcoin,BlockFi Rewards Credit Card,"I was just approved for the card and should receive it in a week's time. 

My understanding is that instead of Bitcoin, I will receive 1.5x points per $1 spent the card but that's it is actually rewarded in ""BlockFi Cryptocurrency Rewards Points."" Once the points are deposited into my BlockFi account, it then gets converted into bitcoin.

My question is: How does BlockFi determine how much Bitcoin is actually received? Since it's still being converted from $1 spent to rewards and then into Bitcoin, what is their determination of Bitcoin reward?

Example: $10,000 spent = 150 BlockFi Cryptocurrency Rewards Points = ??? Bitcoin

If the 150 Rewards Points = $150, then that amount of Bitcoin rewards could vary depending on the time it's rewarded to me and price of Bitcoin at that time. 

Surely BlockFi isn't going to be evaluating the time of each purchase on the credit card and correlate it to the price of BTC at that point in time to adjust the rewards accordingly?

Bitcoin,Visualizing Bitcoin Lightning Network growth and Taproot upgrade explained,"What is Lightning Network? (ELI5)

Lightning Network is a decentralized layer-2 network protocol that uses a native smart contract scripting language to enable instant, almost feeless Bitcoin payments.

On the Lightning Network, both parties to a transaction are required only to have a sufficiently funded open channel on the network. This is done through a single on-chain transaction.

If there is a direct channel open between the parties, the transaction is routed directly and incurs zero fees. Without a direct channel, the transaction is routed through routing nodes.

Whan a transaction passes through a routing node, it is referred to as a ""hop"". There are currently 23k nodes on the Lightning Network with 13k nodes having active channels.

Three years ago, Lightning Network was admittedly far from ideal.

*Processing img h9ll0z9rwkc71...*

But the network has seen exponential growth since, particularly this year. Lightning Network is now nigh-on a fully functional global payments network secured by the Bitcoin blockchain. Lightning wallets have also come a long way and are now very intuitive to use for the average user.

*Processing img 1auw5sjvwkc71...*

Network capacity has doubled this year. Likewise, nodes and channels have grown exponentially,  reducing the number of hops, channel lifespan and fee incurred for hops through routing nodes.

*Processing img cow6o2aywkc71...*

The growth of the Lightning Network has inspired some pretty cool developments this year,

Following the success of the Bitcoin beach project, a pilot for Lightning Network's viability as MoE, El Salvador has adopted Bitcoin on the LN as legal tender.

Other countries like Tonga, Colombia and a few other LatAm countries have expressed interest to follow suit.

Twitter will launch a tipping system on its platform later this year using the Lightning Network.

*Processing img gd1odw5qxkc71...*

**Taproot**

Now with Lightning Network's maturation as an instant, almost feeless, infinitely scalable decentralized global payments network, Bitcoin is shifting focus to its next big milestone, Taproot.

Taproot brings a set of protocols that further enhance Bitcoin's scalability through even more efficient use of block space by introducing a new type of output - Pay to Taproot (P2TR).

P2TR uses Schnorr signatures, which are more compact than the conventional Elliptic Curve Digital Signing Algorithm (ECDSA) signatures. Schnorr signatures are between 6 and 9 bytes shorter than ECDSA.

An even more exciting aspect of Schnorr signatures is that it enables the aggregation of multiple signatures into a single signature. This opens up infinite possibilities, including being able to execute multi-sigs and L2/sidechain smart contracts as a simple regular transaction on-chain.

It's a truly game-changing development, as it allows Bitcoin to have smart contract protocols without bloating the blockchain layer.

Taproot also includes optimization for the Lightning Network called Point Time-Locked Contract(PTLC). PTLC replaced Hash Time-Locked Contract(HTLC). PTLC uses adaptor signatures which enhance privacy and security on the Lightning Network, enable escrow contracts in Lightning channels and allow users to retry stuck payments.

I am have been trading in the spot market using btc as my base currency for some years now. I want to jump to the options market as well but I got the doubt, is there any place where I can trade options using btc as base currency against altcoins ? I don‚Äôt want to get usd ( most of places I have seen use stable coin pairs), I want to keep stacking sats. Do you know a place or the reason why there is not such a market ?

Bitcoin,"Can bitcoin forks improve upon the current bitcoin structure by making it better, cleaner and more eco friendly","During my research I came upon Bitcoin Latinum, This BTC fork that claims to improve upon Bitcoin by bringing lower transaction fees, better transaction speed and a lot more security. My question is that are these forks really going to be able to improve on Satoshi's work and make it a lot better? or are a lot of them just looking for a quick buck and to possibly be the next big thing?

I personally don't think any forks are going to be as big as BTC, It took years for BTC to get to how mainstream it has begun and it's going to take forks a VERY long time to come even close. What do you guys think?",1626869965,GentlemanGengar1,True,1,8,2021-07-21

Bitcoin,Paying cash at my barbershop made me understand Bitcoin. And i hate it.,"I'm living in a country where you can pay by card almost everywhere. 

When I was paying for my new haircut my barber said  ""screw them. I accept just cash"".  
He didn't say who ""them"" is, but it doesn't matter. ""They"" are real for him and he doesn't want them to stand between him and me.  
I may be stupid, but after years of casually reading about btc, his statement made me finally understand what ""electronic peer-to-peer cash with limited supply"" really means. 

And why the idea is huge.

After I made this realisation, I will never go back to the ""store of value"" narrative. This is just for rich pricks and moonbois who want become rich pricks too. Store of value is just fancy gold and not a better world for everybody.

I will never be fanatic about any altcoin again. It takes a Satoshi Nakamoto and many many years of gaining trust for a project to get a chance of becoming the world currency.

Unfortunately... I also realised how far away we are from achiving Satoshi Nakamoto dream.  


We can't use Bitcoin directly, we have to rely on LN, which isn't perfect at all...   
Bitcoin is not anonymous as it could be...  
There are so many whales with malicious intentions...

Bitcoin,If You Own 0.25 BTC Then You Own More Bitcoin Than 99% Of The World!,"
This is not opinion. It is mathematical fact. There is really no way around it as long as we make two assumptions.
1.) There will be a maximum of 21,000,000 BTC ever. If there is less (which there is) this only proves my point further. 2.) The population of earth stays at 7,700,000,000 or increases. If the population were to decrease then my numbers would be off a little but it will still hold true.
With those assumptions, the fact is that if you own 0.25 BTC now or in the future... that you own more Bitcoin than 99% of the world.
This is not arguable. There are a maximum of 21,000,000 coins so let‚Äôs pretend they are all available. None are lost or in Satoshi‚Äôs wallets.
21,000,000 / 0.25 BTC = 84,000,000
That means there are 84,000,000 segments of 0.25 BTC available.
84,000,000 / 7,700,000,000 = 0.010901
So as long as you own 0.25 BTC you own more bitcoin than 99% of the world. You are in the top 1%!
And in reality, we know that only 18.5m have been released. And 1m is in Satoshi‚Äôs wallets and they say 3m has been lost. If that‚Äôs the case then lower the 21,000,000 to 14.5 million and you would only need own 0.20 BTC to have more than 99% of the world.
Again, there is no getting around this. It is fact. It doesn‚Äôt matter if 1 person had the other 20,999,999.75 bitcoins. Your 0.25 BTC means you own more than 99% of the world. You would not necessarily be in the top 1% of bitcoin holders. You simply own more than 99% of the world. It is impossible for you to fall out of that number if you have a quarter bitcoin.
0.25 and HODL

If you have 0.25 BTC at the moment, you have the equivalent  of  8000$ in a savings account.
The average American has about $4,500 in savings.
By 2026, BTC will likely be over $100,000, putting that 0.25 BTC at $25,000.
So, long before all the Bitcoins are mined (around 2140), that small amount of BTC (0.25) will exceed most American savings by factors of 10 or 100.
By 2031 (about 10 years away), you'll likely have a comfortable nest egg for retirement ($250,000), assuming you own your own home, have a good 401k retirement plan and medical coverage.
If you have 0.25 BTC, you're a very lucky person. But don't let it go to your head. Live modestly, eat healthy and keep fit.
No one enjoys regular visits to the hospital, even if the doctor is a nubile blonde who does amazing things with her glove.

According to markets research. ‚Äú The cryptocurrency market, this market was valued at USD 541.0 Million in 2017 and is expected to reach USD 2,902.0 Million by 2023, at a CAGR of 32.31% between 2017 and 2023. The cryptocurrency market is witnessing significant growth because of the benefits of compliance-free peer-to-peer transaction, cross-border remittance transfer, and increase in use cases, as well as some macro drivers such as volatility in the stock market and fluctuating monetary regulations in different countries. The growth of the cryptocurrency market is further propelled by the transparency and immutability of the distributed ledger technology and benefits such as faster transaction and reduction in total ownership cost.‚Äù
This clearly indicates that the various benefits of cryptocurrencies coupled with the fact that it acts as insurance against national economic failure has helped it find many takers. It would not be far-fetched to see cryptos fast becoming the currency of choice in 2030 as it epitomizes personal freedom.

# What Is Bitcoin? 

Bitcoin is high-level money made in January 2009. It follows the considerations set out in a whitepaper by the bewildering and pseudonymous [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://cult.today/a-week-in-which-we-are-all-satoshi/).  The identity of the individual or people who made the innovation is as yet a secret. Bitcoin offers the guarantee of lower exchange charges than conventional online installment instruments and, not at all like officially sanctioned monetary standards, it is worked by a decentralized position.

[Bitcoin](https://cult.today/category/max/bitcoin/) is a sort of cryptographic money. There is no physical bitcoin, just correspondence kept on a freely available report that everyone has direct permission to. All bitcoin trades are affirmed by a huge proportion of handling power. Bitcoin isn't given or supported by any banks or governments, nor is an individual bitcoin important as an item. In spite of its anything but being legitimate delicate in many pieces of the world, bitcoin is famous and has set off the dispatch of many other cryptographic forms of cash, overall implied as altcoins. Bitcoin is ordinarily contracted as ""BTC."" 

## KEY TAKEAWAYS 

¬∑ Dispatched in 2009, bitcoin is the world's greatest advanced cash market capitalization.

¬∑ In contrast to fiat cash, bitcoin is made, appropriated, exchanged, and put away with the utilization of a decentralized record framework, known as a blockchain. 

¬∑ Bitcoin's arrangement of encounters as a store of huge worth has been wild; it has gone through a couple of examples of win and fizzles over its modestly short future. 

¬∑ As the soonest virtual cash to meet far and wide notoriety and achievement, bitcoin has propelled a large group of other digital forms of money afterward. 

## Understanding Bitcoin

The bitcoin system is a grouping of PCs (similarly insinuated as ""center points"" or ""backhoes"") that all run bitcoin's code and store its blockchain. Symbolically, a blockchain can be considered as an arrangement of squares. In each square is a collection of trades. Since all of the PCs running the blockchain have comparative once-over of squares and trades, and can clearly see these new squares being stacked up with new bitcoin trades, it's not possible for anyone to cheat the system.

Anyone‚Äîwhether or not they run a bitcoin ""center"" or not‚Äîcan see these trades happening persistently. To accomplish an evil demonstration, an agitator would have to work 51% of the processing power that makes up bitcoin. Bitcoin has around 10,000 center points, as of June 2021, and this number is creating, making such an attack improbable.

Yet, on the off chance that an assault was to occur, bitcoin excavators‚Äîindividuals who partake in the bitcoin network with their PCs‚Äîwould probably fork to another [blockchain](https://cult.today/category/max/blocks-and-chains/), putting forth the attempt the provocateur set off to accomplish the assault a waste.

Harmonies of bitcoin tokens are continued using public and covered up ""keys,"" which are long series of numbers and letters associated through the mathematical encryption computation that was used to make them. The public key (basically indistinguishable from a record number) fills in as the area circulated to the world and to which others may send bitcoin.

The private key (like an ATM PIN) is planned to be an ensured secret and basically used to endorse bitcoin transmissions. Bitcoin keys should not be confused with a bitcoin wallet, which is a physical or progressed contraption that works with the trading of bitcoin and licenses customers to follow duty regarding. The articulation ""wallet"" is fairly tricky, as bitcoin's decentralized nature suggests it is once in a while taken care of ""in"" a wallet, however rather decentrally on a [blockchain](https://cult.today/do-you-really-know-how-blockchain-works/).",1626857408,Culttoday,True,1,1,2021-07-21

**Summary**: There is a scammer impersonating Mr. Leon Li (Huobi CEO) to ask me to invest 1 BTC in order to receive 6 BTC per week. This scammer's Facebook is in the top of Google search because the Huobi CEO does not publicize his personal Facebook. The scammer also video called me and play a muted video of Leon Li for a few seconds and said there is a problem with the connection to make me into believing him. And here is the story of how I ""tricked"" this scammer lol

I have long been annoyed with scammers because every now and then I get scam/spam calls. I used the Page Editor extension on Chrome to create some screenshots to convince the scammer that I transferred 1 BTC to him but was blocked by Binance because of the high risk. To verify, the scammer needs to transfer 0.001 BTC ($31) back to that wallet. So he really did it haha

Bitcoin,"I wrote an algorithm to buy cryptocurrency based on what coins Reddit talks about positively and I've been running it for 3 weeks, here are the results","Reddit feels positively about Bitcoin? Let‚Äôs buy some. Reddit likes ALGO today ‚Äì great let‚Äôs get some of that as well.¬†

I built an algorithm to do just that, you can see a detailed guide on how to set up your own reddit sentiment crypto trading bot [here](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/07/10/coding-a-crypto-trading-algorithm-that-analyses-reddit-sentiment/) and I have been testing it for about three weeks now.

Today it‚Äôs time to look at the overall performance, as well as how the bot logic has worked in general.

During this testing period the bot has accumulated 20 out of the top 40 coins by Marketcap: BTC, ETH, ALGO, XLM, ADA, SOL, LINK, DOGE, MATIC, XTZ, LTC, VET, DAI, CAKE, DOT, EOS, AAVE, XMR, MKR, ATOM.

The parameters I gave my crypto trading bot is to only look for keywords from the top 40 coins by marketcap, in order to stop it from buying into scams or other suspicious projects. Within 3 weeks the bot has invested in half of the top 40 coins.

Looking at some of the coins that weren‚Äôt picked up by our bot tends to reveal an interesting conclusion: USDT, BUSD, BNB, USDC, UNI, Crypto.com, SHIBA. Although these are in top 40, Reddit didn‚Äôt bother talking about them, or not positively at any rate.

What these coins have in common is that most of them are transactional tokens, stablecoins, or downright useless coins (looking at you SHIBA). As a Redditor myself, I‚Äôm quite proud of the result generated by the hivemind, yes DOGE is there but it doesn‚Äôt matter. Most coins picked by the trading bot with help of the Reddit sentiment are coins that I would invest into myself.¬†

For now the return on our investment doesn‚Äôt look so great. But then again, no accumulation strategy will perform well in a downtrend so this is not representative of the overall result. The outcome is relatively predictable, if the market is up, we‚Äôre up as we‚Äôre buying the actual asset and not using CFDs or futures trading.

Overall I‚Äôm on 15% loss, but as the entire market is down, this is not indicative of the performance. The data that does get me excited is the quality of the coins bought, which means that if nothing else, this could be an automated buy and hold diversification strategy.

See how you can set this up yourself to use in test mode or live mode (at your own risk).

Bitcoin,From riches to rags,"7 months ago I invested 9000$ in crypto, I invested in the coins that have good fundamentals like ( link, eth and btc). A month later my 9k investment turned to 12000$ Which felt amazing to accomplish.   then the market started to crash and a few weeks later the 12000$ was turned into 7000$ and I didn‚Äôt sell my coins.
Cause I thought we are going to bounce but it never happened, and everyone was screaming (HODL TO THE MOON) or some shit like that eventually the 7000$ turned to 3500$. I started to panic, so I decided to invest into future trading cause I heard it can make big profits. Even tho my friend didn‚Äôt recommend it cause it‚Äôs risky but I thought fuck it go big or go home. He was right cause after about 3weeks of trading futures the 3500$ is gone, and as of today I woke up with like 11$ left in my portfolio. I learned a lot from my mistakes and also alot about the crypto space. I‚Äôve saved up some money and im planning to reinvest somewhere around 2000-5000$ in the next few weeks and holding them for the next couple of years.

I know, it's all a charade, but nonetheless interesting to watch.

I also dislike EM. But I like Jack and Cathy.

Let's see what actually happens tomorrow! Here's the livestream link:

Bitcoin,"Blockchain Experts of Reddit, how likely/how much more likely is a 51% attack on Bitcoin Blockchain given the Chinese ban (78.89% of recorded miners) on mining?","One of the first things I made sure to remember before investing in BTC was to understand as best as possible how the blockchain works and what are it's security flaws. The original paper can be found at  [https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper)  

The most important line ""As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.""

&amp;#x200B;

There's something I noticed while going through hash rate data that I found quite concerning from a security of the blockchain perspective. I didn't even think to look into hash rates until another user mentioned the hash ribbon indicator on Tradingview.com

The hash rate estimated on 04/14/2021 peaked at 198.514 m TH/s. The hash rate estimated on 06/26/2021 hit a low of 58.461 m TH/s. This was found at blockchain.com using the raw values in the past year. That's a drop of 70.55% in 73 days. 

[https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, according to nature scientific journal, China made up a large percent (75%) of the mining capacity of the blockchain. If the ban was truly in effect and China miners actually shut down, the drop in hash rate would make sense.

[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22256-3.pdf](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22256-3.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

With that large of a drop in miners, the possibility of a coordinated 51% attack because much easier, simply because the overwhelming majority of miners maintaining and building true blocks on the blockchain have been removed.

What are the short term and long term impacts if one were to occur to: price, trust in Bitcoin, trust in blockchain? 

&amp;#x200B;

It's also worth noting that #11 Calculations in the original paper goes through the probability of a successful attack and how they could be implemented. I will say that it may not be worth trying to do the attack unless the transaction was valued greater than the cost of ((current hashrate \* amount of time maintaining blockchain) + cost of equipment), unless they are willing to waste money to really screw with someone/entity/government.

I guess it's also worth noting that El Salvador was the first country to make it legal tender, so I would say they are at the greatest risk of an attack. Just my thoughts.",1626841446,madeofchemicals,True,1,7,2021-07-21

Bitcoin,My bank shut down my account and banned me for life after trying to buy bitcoin from Kraken. What do I do?,"Hey guys, I will make this post short so it is quick and easy to read, I am asking advice because my bank (or rather credit union) recently did something to me that is really unfair and pissed me off, so I want to get some compensation for it or try to hold them accountable. I am pretty sure what did they is illegal/not allowed and I need some help or guidance from the community. Any help is greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Ontario, Canada and I do personal banking with Meridian Credit Union (I know, they're a crap company). I recently signed up for the bitcoin platform Kraken, after hearing about it here. I got verified, submitted my ID and went to make a purchase for some Bitcoin off their website. I was instructed to send a bank wire to their overseas account so I could complete the purchase. The next day I went to my local credit union (Meridian Credit Union), which is not technically a bank but for all intents and purposes works the exact same way. I had all the money lined up in my account (about 25K CAD) and was ready to buy a bitcoin (purchase was for about 0.6 BTC).

&amp;#x200B;

I sent out the wire and I chatted with the teller, told them I heard about Kraken and that I was buying bitcoin for the first time. Explained I saw it as an exciting opportunity and wanted to make some money off of my investment. The one teller was really nice but the other was being kind of nosey and rude. I don't want to assume things but she seemed like a Karen and kept asking where the money came from, how I got it and if it is mine, kept acting shocked that I had 25K of disposable income to spend, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, fast forward a few days and the wire is not received by Kraken, despite all the info being correct. I call up my credit union and ask what's wrong, turns out the bank ""flagged"" the wire for ""Security reasons"" or suspicious activity. Eventually after a week of fighting with them over it, the wire was eventually reversed and bounced back into my account (minus a 50 dollar fee). I was not able to buy the bitcoin and my bank blocked me from sending a payment to Kraken.

&amp;#x200B;

That alone would be fine and I would have moved on, but it gets worse. About a week or two later, I got a call from my credit union (Meridian) and they called me to inform me I was permanently banned from Meridian and they would be closing down my account, and I had to come withdraw all my money so they could close it. I asked if I could be reinstated and they said no, I was banned for life and I wouldn't be allowed to reopen a new account. I asked why and they said over the phone there was ""suspicious or illegal activity"" coming from my bank account, and they could not work with me any further. I am not involved with any illegal activity whatsoever, my income is 100% legal (I work for a company and get T4 slips) and it was my first time ever buying bitcoin in my entire life. It seems like the conversation I had with the teller about Kraken ""tipped them off"" and they misunderstood it as being something illegal.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on the harshness of the lady's tone over the phone, I am worried they possibly even alerted authorities or tried calling the cops on me because of this stupid Karen who works at the bank. I now have to switch banks to a new provider (eg BMO or RBC) and every time I go to Meridian now (for things like cancelling my cards or withdrawing my money) the Karen at the teller gives me a really hard time.

&amp;#x200B;

So what gives? This is absolutely ridiculous and I did not expect this to happen. What do I do? Is there any way I can try complain somewhere or demand some sort of compensation? I feel like the whole situation is extremely unfair and a big misunderstanding, and I also don't even think a bank or credit union is allowed to do this to someone, especially a paying customer. So what do I do? What are my options for demanding compensation? Is it possible to take legal action against them or is doing so a waste of my time?

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin,external HDD question," Hi, so I am running bitcoin core on my laptop and I just plugged in a 500 GB SD card so I can store the blocks and chainstate folders to save storage in my laptops HDD.  

At first tried to transfer the blocks folder from my laptops HDD to the SD card but I was having trouble with that. So I backed up my wallet.dat and deleted bitcoin core /all files and decided to download the entire blockchain again. 

I edited the bitcoin.conf file to direct to the SD card which is datadir=D:/Bitcoin.

Everything is going well blocks downloading on SD card but my question is when I add my old wallet.dat to the new bitcoin core data do I need to transfer It to the SD card or %appdata%/bitcoin on my laptops hdd? 

i uploaded pictures of my SD card folder and my %appdata% folder (appdata folder could be files left behind from my old bitcoin core data, wallet file in appdata folder is not my backup) which is why im confused 

I am assuming a SD card will work very similarly if not the exact same way as a external HDD would so i hope i can get some help

Bitcoin,Companies should sell products at fixed bitcoin prices no matter what the usd value is,"I think if we want to see any price stability with bitcoin then companies should sell their products at a fixed bitcoin price in order to establish price floors.

For example, let's say a tesla model 3 was priced at 1 bitcoin. No matter what the price of bitcoin is in terms of USD this car will always sell for 1 bitcoin. This helps create a price floor for bitcoin. People would be incentivized to buy up bitcoin at current prices because they know they'd be getting a deal if they were to buy something worth 29k and use it to purchase a car worth 35k. The demand of people wanting to buy bitcoin in order to get a discount on the car would actually push the price up back to 35k.

Another option companies can do would be to buy up large amounts of bitcoin over the counter at today's prices and then offer product at extremely cheap bitcoin prices. For example, a company like Lamborghini could theoretically purchase a billion dollars worth of bitcoin OTC today for $29k per bitcoin. They then announce that the newest Lamborghini model will sell for exactly 1 bitcoin no matter what the current USD price is. Imagine people finding out that they can buy a 300k car for just 1 bitcoin which is currently at 29k... this would cause the price to skyrocket and we'd potentially see a new price floor near 300k for bitcoin due to all the demand from people buying up cheap bitcoin today in order to purchase a very luxurious car. Lamborghini as a company then benefits vastly because their OTC purchase of 1 billion dollars of bitcoin is suddenly worth 10 billion. They also wouldn't be losing any money selling a 300k car for 1 bitcoin today because pricing their latest Lamborghini at 1 bitcoin would create enough demand to establish a price floor at 300k.",1626829553,Expired_Lizard_Milk,True,1,16,2021-07-21

Bitcoin,Big Tech's next move for Bitcoin tomorrow? I think so.," Completely hammered by sustainability FUD. 

Quick recap. Here are the events of thinking us westerners used to get here this cycle, as per the public‚Äôs focus and the media's amplification:

1. **Jan 8 Elon Musk puts Bitcoin on TSLA‚Äôs balance sheet, plans to accept payments**

*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if it makes sense for TSLA to buy Bitcoin \[‚Ä¶\] but I do think it could be a catalyst for sustainable energy.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFrom the Ark Invest Podcast Feb, 2019*

The corporate treasury move was foreshadowed by his Twitter interactions with Michael Saylor

2**. Bitcoin consumes energy and therefore results in CO2 emissions (exponentially so during euphoric price action)**

Which he was surely aware of beforehand 

3. **TSLA stops accepting Bitcoin as payment may 12**

ESG pressuring TSLA is a highly likely outcome for this cyclical problem in which Musk has no choice but to comply, and it's not worth the publicity hazard if his company were complicit.

So far as I see it, there are two possibilities. Elon had basically no idea what he was doing, and recklessly gambled with TSLA‚Äôs balance sheet. Or this is somehow a favorable situation. He is bringing attention to the problem before presenting the solution.

&amp;#x200B;

# ""Tesla will resume accepting bitcoin payments for its cars once miners of the cryptocurrency can show they are using roughly 50% clean energy""

 \- Elon's twitter (a somewhat reliable source)

We shouldn‚Äôt put the man on a pedestal, or assume he‚Äôs altruistic. There are plenty of incentives within the largest crypto communities for him to maneuver. Big Tech shall have their way regardless, as they offer valuable influence in the battle of information. In this battlefield social media is already the marketing frontier for such debates, while traditional media is at best only incentivized to cover the controversies. Terms like ‚Äúgreen-washing‚Äù imply cultism, or more importantly, that no debate is worth hosting.

But for Proof of Work blockchain technologies, it may be the most interesting topic to consider. Ominously, it‚Äôs the cliff hanger Hal Finney‚Ää, ‚Ääearly contributor and first receiver of Bitcoin‚Ää, ‚Ääleft as his last tweet related to the crypto.

[https://i.imgur.com/nyoZTav.png](https://i.imgur.com/nyoZTav.png)

To be clear, neither side is currently capable of fully proving their point. Jack, Cathie and I‚Äôm sure Elon will put on a good show. If the mining counsel‚Äôs data is considered reliable and more complete, it‚Äôll unlock a more resilient narrative for Bitcoiners. If their ventures create economic incentives for developing sustainable infrastructures, in it may change the whole ball-game. With only their (quite) incomplete paper so far released, these remain fantastical concepts held by those with the power to actually change the world.

I have asked blockchain.com to either return the wires to my bank or credit my account. It has now been 12 days and I have yet to receive a response. I have opened multiple tickets, but just silence?

My account activity just shows the deposit on July 11 and BTC purchase the same day. But my account balance is now $30. Why is there no record of any activity? What has happened to my money? I opened my first ticket for this matter on July 11 - it is now 9 days later and I have not heard a peep.    
3). I have wanted to sell the BTC that I bought on July 11, but I cannot trade it. I have to wait for Compliance to finish their review - it's been 9 days already!  Who will be responsible for the losses?

Bitcoin,Update to the situation in which I sent $5000 in btc to the wrong address. I got the money back! (Original story linked inside),"This is a follow up to 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/oda6uf/accidentally_sent_btc_to_an_input_address_from_a

This all began on July 3rd.

After I noticed the wallet I sent it to was an output address used by Kraken I immediately emailed them asking for help and what my options were. 

Over the course of the next week I sent many emails back and forth explaining the situation and how I meant to send it to a Coinbase wallet but accidentally long-pressed on an output address used in the transaction from Kraken to my Electrum wallet.

Finally they send me an email saying they've identified the owner of the account and would be emailing them to ask if they would allow their email to be shared with me so we could actually speak and resolve the situation.

The guy ended up being from Brazil and when he received the money he moved it to an online Casino where he proceeded to lose $2000 before seeing the email from Kraken.

After seeing the email from Kraken, he actually emailed me! It took a lot of convincing that this wasn't some sort of elaborate scam and I explained that the $2k ""lost"" wouldnt be a problem if he returned the rest of the money.

He wanted me to sign some sort of contract stating what happened, we both signed it and this morning I woke up to .10 in my Electrum wallet.

Holy. Fucking. Shit.

I just want to send a huge shout-out to Kraken for helping me navigate this ridiculous situation I put myself in.

I want to send an even bigger shout-out to the man that received the coin and was willing to send what was remaining back.

I don't even care about the $2k and I'm honestly hoping he just made that story about the casino up so he could keep the $2k because he deserves it and I know $2k goes a long fuckin way in Brazil so I honestly feel like really good about it. How could I not?

I've never heard a story like this in the btc world. Ive been trading since 2013 and never made the mistake of sending money to the wrong address and the stories I've heard of people who have, I've never heard of a story of that btc being recovered in such a fashion.

I am beside myself with joy. It looks like I'll be able to buy the car I want after all.

I've always said I'm simultaneously the luckiest/unluckiest person I know and this is solid fuckin evidence right here.

THANK YOU KRAKEN!

THANK YOU UNNAMED BRAZILIAN GUY!

I quite literally thought I lost that money for good and this whole ordeal has been such a whirlwind. I'm so glad it's been resolved but it wouldn't have been if I didn't study the Blockchain and followed the money, and even then 99.9% you won't get your money back but I actually fuckin did. 

I'm agnostic and this nearly made me believe in God lol

Bitcoin,Proof of Market Manipulation,"Jk, you're all just salty that your long position has gotten smacked around so much. I'll say it, only weak hands and bagholders complain about market manipulation.

Was anyone crying market manipulation when the price shot up to 60k+? Nope. 

Frankly, I've yet to see a clear definition or even an example of true market manipulation, whatever that is.

The only example I've heard of is flooding the market with sell orders to spook the market, allowing you to buy in lower. If you're one of the weak hands who sells as a result of this, I can only hope the person on the other side of the trade has a longer time horizon and a better understanding of bitcoin's value proposition than you do. 

In short, I embrace and welcome more ""Market Manipulation."" It's getting rid of the weak hands, cleaning up this subreddit day by day, and allowing me to continue stacking at a reasonable price.

There is a small minority of folks here who understand and agree with the things I'm saying here, but to those complaining the loudest, we'll see you when you come back during the next ATH. 

For more practical advice, stop checking the price - its that simple.

Bitcoin,A piece of advice,I‚Äôm relatively new to the crypto space and like many of you I didn‚Äôt get in at the best prices. Ever since the dip in may I have averaged down but I‚Äôm still red. Since that dip in may I have spent way too much time staring at red candlesticks all day. That absolutley destroyed my mental health seeing my investment getting rocked and looking at it all day like a gambler. It took me a while but then it hit me: I‚Äôm getting worked up over price moves by the hour by the day which are so meaningless in the long run. For example when bitcoin was trying to recover to 40k I was so sad to see it go back to 38k. Now I wish it went to 38k. When I became aware of this I realized how stupid staring at charts are especially if I‚Äôm not even trading. I also became aware of how meanglingless price changes are. I took time away from the charts to study and understand bitcoin better and my mental health improved dramatacilayy. I used to have guh movements when bitcoin would drop and now I‚Äôm kinda numb to it. I would advise you alll to understand the tech better take a break from the charts. And read up on al the great news for bitcoin.  It‚Äôs literally being adopted. Who cares about the price rn this shows how the tech is working. What else do you need to see the bullish picture.

Even now I am setting my buy orders in the low 20‚Äôs all the way down to 13k. Patience will always play a huge role in your success in this crypto game. If you‚Äôre stuck in bad positions don‚Äôt worry bc BTC is known for surprises. Who knows exactly what the end of the year will bring! My advice is to have a strategy and clear entry and exit points. Set buy orders to avoid fomo‚Äôing in and stick to your plan. Being ready for ANY situation is the best way to play the game.

actually on ledger i ve a 'fake' wallet attached to a PIN and a 'real' wallet attached to an other PIN.

so when i login on ledger if i put one pin i log on a wallet, if i put the other pin i log on a different wallet, is possible do it or something similar on CC? i like things like this and the plausible deniability.

Bitcoin,What can we learn from catastrophe theory?,"Many people are chartists and chase trends. When too many chartists take part in the market, its often time to take profits (hence the cliche: when your cab driver starts talking about bitcoin, its time to sell). This is what initializes market corrections like the one we have seen. Fundamentalists start taking profits, and so the trends start reverting, and the chartists then exit the market, and so we get a correction. When fundamentalists start considering the asset underpriced again, they will re-enter. And once trend reversal is confirmed, the chartists start stepping back in. Rinse and repeat. Check out this paper by Zeeman (1974): https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304406874900342 . You can read it without any deep insight to mathematics. I highly recommend this paper. It is a beautiful paper imho.

I guess the takeaway is that now is a good time to start investing in BTC through DCA. You stop your DCA scheme when trend is reversed to the upside and price steps back above your average price. Then you just hold for a while, and then you start taking profits gradually as things get more heated. Dont make the mistake of not taking profits along the way. You can use the profits that you now keep in cash to reinvest in the next correction. Not financial advice by the way‚Ä¶",1626796770,ZypherBro,True,1,0,2021-07-20

I‚Äôve been investing in general long enough to not panic during market fluctuations.

Anyhow, I‚Äôm in the US and I‚Äôve been reading some stuff about the Biden administration, regulations regarding carbon footprints, govt fear of crypto, etc. It talks about the digital dollar which is the same direction yen &amp; the euro are going in but more important it talks about the strangulation by regulation of BTC. Kind of similar to how the govt punishes car manufacturers for not meeting certain emissions standards. Now considering there‚Äôs $21 mil BTC and less than $3 mil remaining to be mined, would it even matter at this point? My thinking would be it‚Äôs more than 3/4 mined and if it became more expensive to mine the remainder that would be a good thing for driving value up, if anything. Am I wrong there?

Bitcoin,Interesting chat i had with a uber rider about bitcoin,"last night I took a gentleman on a half hour uber ride and he said some things about bitcoin that i just can‚Äôt stop thinking about. He works in tech (i didn‚Äôt ask the specifics) and was traveling to the city with coworkers to (i think) celebrate something that happened at work related to crypto and bitcoin. I just wanted to ask some people more informed than I if the things he said were true.

basically the gist was that right now, everybody that‚Äôs well off and has disposable income is investing in bitcoin because it‚Äôs going to be the next big thing. and they really really don‚Äôt want normal joes like me to come to this realization and invest (thereby taking their potential gains). he mentioned something vague about tying bitcoin to the american dollar that went right over my head. 

he went on to tell me every week when i get paid, invest whatever you have into their stock and absolutely do not touch it. ‚Äújust forget about it‚Äù is what he said. his passion for bitcoin was readily apparent in how he spoke of it and part of the reason he was so convincing. 

he didn‚Äôt hard sell me too much on it, just the basics really. he was really pleasant and left a good tip. i don‚Äôt see any constructive reason for him to lie to a complete stranger.... but he is a stranger so here i am ‚Äîasking for second opinions (from more strangers on the internet) lol.

i do have money i don‚Äôt need right now that i could potentially invest and ‚Äújust forget about it‚Äù. but still you never know. also i know very little about crypto so if this is common knowledge in this sub i apologize.",1626795228,Buffalo_Loaders,True,1,14,2021-07-20

Bitcoin,Could someone please explain how the market is played by the whales?,"  

Hi Everyone, newbie here. There‚Äôs something I‚Äôm struggling to properly understand, if any of you could guide my thinking that‚Äôd be great. Here goes:

Nobody knows the fundamental value of bitcoin yet, so market moves on speculation. Everyone says that market is being manipulated by whales ‚Äì they make the price go down, small investors panic and sell, and whales buy more at downward-moving prices. But, ultimately, when the whales have had their fill, how do they make the market go up again? Is it by just spreading hopeful news and hoping there is enough trade between whatever small investors are left in the game, to drive the prices up? Or is it by starting to sell from their own stash and hoping small investors pick it up at upward-moving prices now?

If it‚Äôs the latter, what‚Äôs the catch? Let‚Äôs say they bought 1 coin at 50K, 40K and 30K each earlier. Now thy sell 1 at 30K, 40K, 50K each? Or maybe 31K, 41K and 51K, if they play it well? But is that it? Marginal profits? Where are the big gains?

Where am I wrong?

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin price July 2013 - $66, December 2013 - $1163. July 2017 - $1830, December 2017 - $19700. Current price action is standard bull cycle consolidation (Fibonacci Analysis)","**The Golden Ratio**

Some of you may not know about Fibonacci ratios but that's ok. I will not overcomplicate this post and you don't need to be a TA expert to understand it.

Suffice to say, these ratios, particularly what's referred to as the golden ratio (1.618), aren't limited to TA, but ubiquitous in all nature and cosmos.

Fans of The Da Vinci Code will remember Professor Langton explaining how mathematics and art collide via the 'golden ratio.'

The golden ratio is sometimes called the ""divine proportion,"" because of its frequency in the natural world. Space-time itself is defined by this mathematical constant. Naturally, we humans, are somehow programmed to act in accordance with this ratio in everything we do.

**Golden Ratio in Bitcoin**

Bitcoin's price action right now is following the exact same pattern that it did in 2013 and 2017. Let's take a look. These charts are very easy to follow,

[First big run, new ATH and correction to 1.618 \(2011-2013\)](https://preview.redd.it/btz4233otdc71.png?width=1558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e202930c48f7ed3ac3e6a9c200fe3b47e3960f2)

[Same pattern \(2013-2017\)](https://preview.redd.it/0a89pscutdc71.png?width=1558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bcf184dc809a8695e9202ff0749e9f92233ca02)

[Unerringly rhythmical \(2017-2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/w443ztdxtdc71.png?width=1559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff4d1b5aeb6c793e396a177e9b95959452859c58)

When Steve Wozniak called Bitcoin a mathematical miracle, he wasn't kidding. Whatever makes the price action so unerringly rhythmical this way between halving cycles can be empirically analyzed by humans similar to the patterns in nature but never fully understood.

It once again begs the question if Mathematics was invented or discovered.

I was already super excited 3 years ago to observe whether the same pattern would play out again. To see it play out exactly the same way (so far) is nothing short of spine-chilling.

You can check out the two pinned posts on my profile.

In February 2018, when everyone was panicking, I pointed out that we would go back to 19k and beyond in the next cycle.

Back then, I hadn't yet analyzed the price action this closely but I knew the quadrennial cycles.

Then in December last year, I called for $100k before the end of 2021 which I still stand by.

Similar to my prediction in 2018, I understand that this may be too optimistic to imagine right at this moment.

In my personal opinion, it's very likely that 29k turns out to be the bottom for this correction phase.

But you should of course DYOR.",1626793314,xcryptogurux,True,1,173,2021-07-20

Bitcoin,"I've been learning about crypto for about 6 months, is this a good description for what bitcoin is as a whole? Am I missing anything?","Bitcoin is a distributed ledger that is split into blocks which are sent to nodes who save it and store it. Each block is simply a bunch of transactions from wallets. A block is generated every 10 minutes by miners who perform hash functions to achieve the target difficulty. 

When the block is hashed by the miners it uses sha-256 encryption which is a 1 way cryptographic function which turns any length of data into a 64 digit hash key (256 bits). The hash of the previous block is also included in the header of the current block to allow you to go back and verify the order of blocks and to also make it increasingly harder for anyone to go back and change past transactions. 

The miners hash the contents of the block but if the resulting hash isn't equal or lower than the target they try again increasing the nonce. The nonce is simply a number used once which is added to the block to see if it matches the target, if it doesn't the miners try the next number. The first miner to hash the block with the correct nonce that results in a hash below or equal to the target is rewarded with bitcoins. The miner who wins is allowed to publish the block and all the other nodes on the network store it. 

The rewards are decreased every 4 years to maintain a stock to flow model similar to physical gold, by the year 2140 there will be no more rewards given out. The difficulty for mining is also increased (or decreased) every 2016 blocks (about 2 weeks) to accommodate for changing total hash power of the entire bitcoin network, this is to ensure that a block is produced every 10 minutes on average. 

The changing of difficulty is simply the amount of 0's at the start of the hash target for miners. If you don't want to mine bitcoin to acquire it you must go to an exchange and buy it from someone who wants to sell it for fiat money. When you own bitcoins it is stored in a wallet on the network with the entire history of your bitcoins being traceable to when they were first mined.

Your wallet is only kept safe by only you knowing your keys to your wallet, if anyone else has access to them then they essentially have your bitcoins. You can own a hardware wallet which stores your keys offline and never leaves the device to ensure maximum safety.

Many people mistakingly think that bitcoin is anonymous but in reality it is pseudo anonymous as everything is public just without your real name. As long as you never share your wallet address online with identifying information like you name no one can know who owns your wallet, but they can still see your balance and every transaction you have made.

Bitcoin,The crypto wars to come‚Ä¶,So this is the problem in a nutshell.  China is coming out with their own crypto currency.  The unified forced submission of 1.5 billion people to that ecosystem will dominate the landscape.  Anyone who has ever played any online games with Chinese teams will tell you they only have one goal.  Chinese domination.  So we have team China in one corner.  In the other corner we have Bitcoin.  (Check yourself here).  Yeah we have the hundreds of alt coins and eth and all the different branches of the crypto tree.  But that‚Äôs the problem.  Chinas money will not be divided.  They will put everything they have into making sure their digital asset is on top.  So the whole time we are sitting over here jerking off on each other over what the next shit coin one hit wonder is going to be they are at war.  They are at war with Bitcoin.  It‚Äôs in the headlines nonstop.  Wake up!  Ditch all the alts and unify behind one coin.  But that‚Äôs never gonna happen.

The millennials, comparatively speaking, have very, very little in savings and are deeper in debt than the baby boomers were at their age. The simple math leads me to strongly believe that there will be ridiculous government programs that will add ungodly amounts to the deficit by the time millennials reach their 60s.

Bitcoin,"Routing / forwarded transaction summary of a 1 month old LN node that never pretended to be a routing node but more a learning and onboarding platform for friends and family...., how does it look anyway from a routing perspective? take a look","Hi, hope this could help with some of the questions regarding ""will my node route transactions?"". This is in short my experience with the second node I bring to life (first one was decomissioned for personal reasons as I could not attend it properly).... now I have time.

As said in title, we were not preteding to route for a start, but as I'm now having some fun with it there is no excuse to not keep investing some more time on it and share results with those interested. After one month of operations here you have some numbers. I'm not really sure how I got here nor if this pattern is going to continue up or down, but anyway I think is interesting to share the details. You can ask me questions, I'll try to answer them.

You can find info on the node [here](https://1ml.com/node/029b81d1aaf177fa00c1c5796360163bfa98ee4d5d0daa54c6f510d9e237f376e9). Important to note that 2/3rd of the capacity of the node is Inbound atm, and has been like this for the last 2 weeks. All public channels.

So, since the node was born on June 19th, I have routed a total of 144 Tx with a total value of aprox 16Msats, through aprox 55% of the channels opened to the node (inbound and outbound). Most of the activity started to happen like 2 weeks ago, but the node routed it first Tx already on June 20th, so in the first 24h.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u75ks1o7wbc71.png?width=454&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cc5d417c33cb51068d869816100f3c428881629

&amp;#x200B;

Most active channels are routing both ways as you can see bellow and they are routing normally mid-size (200k-700ksat) to very small amounts (&lt;10 sats).

&amp;#x200B;

[Here the split of sats routed through the channels](https://preview.redd.it/hvdje99bwbc71.png?width=1707&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=729ee5d7ce2c1286960191989c142061099e080c)

&amp;#x200B;

[And here a Chord Graph representation of sats flowing thorugh the channels which is cool to see changing every day.](https://preview.redd.it/d3ppbergwbc71.png?width=679&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47f2e96851fcce2a96e113aac34c19641f7bf81d)

It have been very relevant for us to be very careful with sat spent on fees when opening channels or doing any kind of operation, one of the most important tools I guess for a LN operator is keeping an eye on the mempool to make sure you do any on-chain operation at 1sat/vB. In these days onchain can be even cheaper than some LN tx :P so find the moment for making loops in/out or opening new channels.

Bitcoin,"Market may look scary right now, but Bitcoin is serving its true purpose in many other countries as currency for the people. It is quietly having a bullrun in many places. #hodl","

The situation may seem bear right now for those in the USA, Europe. But bitcoin is serving its true purpose in countries such as China and Argentina, it is becoming the currency for the people.

Regardless of what China posting how economy is doing well and recovering well. I can tell u food prices are going through the fucking roof in China. China GDP growth reported 20%, guess what prices of food went up by 50-100% for 99% of necessary items. Majority of the banks is banning any account associated with transferring of money into crypto exchanges. Crypto is almost the only reliable way of sending money outside of the country and holding as a steady investment. China built housing for 4billion people, and population is 1.3billion. It is bubble about to burst any time. The government controls the stock market, theres pretty much no way to make money from stock market.

My friend from Argentina say his country inflation is 50% every year the past few years. He buys bitcoin and send it back to his family monthly. It is only thing that is keeping his family afloat and not becoming dead poor. 

Inflation is killing a lot of the currencies outside of USD, euros. Bitcoin is already having its own bulllrun in those countries regardless of the USD price. It is serving its true purpose as currency of the people. Price will catch on to the rest of the world due to how greedy the governments are getting with the endless money printing. #HODL",1626767251,itzdivz,True,1,41,2021-07-20

Bitcoin,Personal stories about inflation,"I was born and raised in Venezuela, 6 years ago I decided to leave for good. 

During my time there, I witnessed inflation and its consequences first hand, and I learned a few things that helped me maintain some of my purchase power and escape. Many, if not all of the things I will point out are obvious to many of you, many here are knowledgeable and can reach the same conclusions by studying some economics and applying simple logic, I‚Äôm not that smart, I had to suffer it.

Inflation seemed to have started to be a concern for everybody in 1984-1985 during the ‚Äúblack friday‚Äù (no, not that one you know), a day where the government devalued the currency against the dollar by 100% if I‚Äôm correct. My numbers are not exact, I‚Äôm sure if i google them i‚Äôll get them right. It probably started before that, I don‚Äôt know, point is, it was the day that entered into people‚Äôs radar. Things continued to go downhill ever since and, it hasn‚Äôt stopped. 

 ‚ÄúThe rich gets richer, the poor gets poorer‚Äù my dad said it ever since i have memory. It wasn‚Äôt obvious, I didn‚Äôt get it, it took me about 25 years to understand that ‚Äúthe rich‚Äù hold onto assets and not cash, as for the rest, the story is sad. This kind of statements are true but have negative consequences as people start to resent against those who have managed their finances properly and protected themselves, people will say they cheated, it is unfair! The playfield is indeed unfair, but it is not the richs‚Äôs fault. This will usually leads to social unrest, opening pandora‚Äôs box.


‚ÄúPoliticians love to print money‚Äù if rich get richer, the politicians are not exempted, they will adjust their salaries according to the properly measured inflation rates, plus, their missmanaged projects will receive funding at the beginning of the year, so they will have a chance to spend it all before the prices goes up, and lets not even talk about their complicated corrupt schemes to pocket the surplus and deposit it in foreign currencies as a hedge.

Prof Huerta de Soto explains monetary expansion is usually done in a way that spreads like honey being poured on a plate, those who gets it first, gets the best of it before it reaches the edge of the plate.  

 ‚ÄúEnjoy this year, the next one will be worse.‚Äù I heard this so many times, even on TV shows. It is some sort of ‚Äúpositive‚Äù statement for you to cheer up now and enjoy the moment, I‚Äôm not sure if it ever worked. Inflation is a degenerative process, like a disease, it wears down your income, your quality of life, your health. Its consequences can be seeing in the society in general, everythings seems to be in a constant state of decay, first people lose the power to buy their hobbies, then new clothes, then expensive food, then snacks, then cannot afford 3 meals a day. But they still have jobs, and this will lead to my next story.


‚ÄúInflation doesn‚Äôt kill jobs‚Äù it actually does but, let me explain. Is not an atomic bomb that pushes company to declare bankruptcy or forces them to fire everybody in a shocking event. Is toxic gas that slowly kills you, most companies won‚Äôt cease to exist, they will adjust their prices as their costs goes up, they will be forced to lower the quality of their products to compensate the lower sales, but people will remain in their desks living their normal lives, without really thinking about what‚Äôs going on, assuming that everything is just normal. 

I even got used to the fact that prices will always go up, I though it was the natural course of life. It is the governments objective to feed and perpetuate this lie.

‚ÄúCash is trash‚Äù pretty obvious right? people started trading cars as currency, anything was better than holding cash,  cars naturally depreciate over time, like houses or most material things, their rate of appreciation measured against the local currency surpassed the natural depreciation of the asset, in this context, people failed to see that those so called assets or hedges were depreciating, and as they saw their value go up measured in local currency they saw themselves as wealthier, but they were not, they just had a car in their garage.

‚ÄúHedging made me a millionaire‚Äù I wish this would‚Äôve been true in the whole sense of the word. I didn‚Äôt become wealthier, my assets simply were valued now in millions of  the local currency, but I was simply able to afford the same things, maybe a bit more food, maybe a bit more entertainment, it is hard to see wether assets have more value or your pocket have less, or both. Hedging was not a winning lottery ticket, it was a shelter against the toxic gas, there was nothing to celebrate.

‚ÄúCPI is in the realm of macroeconomics, not your finances‚Äù of course macroeconomics affect your finances, but doesn‚Äôt tell you the whole story of what‚Äôs happening in your pocket. The real picture of your finances is in your consumption habits and goals in life, food prices affect you, but if you are hedging against inflation, the inflation of those specific hedges affect you dramatically. If cpi inflation is at 80% annualy but your hedge is inflating 1000% annualy then inflation for you is 1000%.",1626752589,mredvard,True,1,21,2021-07-20

Bitcoin,Scenario,"So if I‚Äôm a business owner and I accept Bitcoin. Let‚Äôs say that I have 10 Bitcoin to start on Monday and the value is $10,000 per coin. I sell you a laptop for .25 Bitcoin on that same Monday when the value is $10,000 per coin. ($2,500) for said laptop. Then say Friday rolls around and the price of Bitcoin has dropped to $7,500 per coin, so if I sold you the laptop for .25 Bitcoin I would be making less than I did on Monday in profit (about $625 less). Would I then charge more for the laptop based on current value of Bitcoin? If so that seems like a lot to keep up with for how volatile it is. Now maybe this is just basics economics and inflation but I don‚Äôt know much about that (marketing major) and I‚Äôm to tired to post more thoughts but think about it both ways as if the market were to fluctuate a couple thousand dollars over a few days.

Everyone I know is way overbought up to their eyeballs in shitcoins. The large players once again trying to manipulate us. Be wary of corporations, trusts, exchanges, and billionairs that may seem like they are on our sides, they are not. They will try and inject their malicious climate control code into core by controlling hashrate. What it will do is attempt to control or claim some power to the network. It could be a long term effort by these entities and a silent one. It could be by surprise or at the node level. Something we possibly have not thought of yet.

Bitcoin,Do you guys think the recent price dip 3 months ago was a market crash or a price correction ?,"I personally believe it‚Äôs a crash and that there was foul play involved. While the prices were in fact inflated, the sudden drop in prices went way beyond what a ‚Äúcorrection‚Äù is supposed to be.

I think it‚Äôs the works of a couple major whales that wanted to capitalize on a price dip and thus created an initially artificial dump that then grew into an organic market panic (this would explain the individual dump that occurred right before the prices dropped)

Like I‚Äôve always said, whales are a PLAGUE to this market in every way possible. And while removing them completely impossible, I‚Äôm glad to see some companies working against them. Some companies like GPool have a zero tolerance community and platform that makes it really hard for whales to single handedly control how the projects will perform.

A price correction would be the easy way to describe what happened. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that simple. We need more companies and platforms to form limits on the games whales are playing.

Bitcoin,Anyone here old enough to remember what happened when banks first started offering their clients Apple stock?," 

If not, here's a quick recap: The media told everyone that Apple was not a good stock to buy or hold and that everyone who owns it should sell it before it crashes and dies during its early days, all while at the same time Banks were adding it to their asset catalog, blocked a majority of their clients from being able to buy it, and only allowed their most wealthy clients to add it to their portfolios.

Sound familiar? It was some hell of what felt like an endless stream of FUD that they spread on Apple, which as you may know is only the most valuable company in the world today.

They scared my poor immigrant dad who came to this country with nothing and started investing in his youth, out of his Apple stock in the '97 for a small $40k profit with their endless stream of FUD news lies. That news stopped him from ever investing back into the market.

And that stock he was scared into selling would be worth millions today. I can only imagine how many other people they scared out of that stock and others like it, who could have greatly improved their lives with those internet tech stock assets.

Because of that experience, I'm never letting them scare me out of selling my Bitcoin. HODL'r for over a decade now, and I will HODL until my kids can inherit my fortune and become HODL'rs themselves",1626721609,SatOnMyBalls_,True,1,162,2021-07-20

Bitcoin,"Art Cult Seeking Global Domination, how?"," 

Hello,

art  cult leader here seeking some theoretical guidance. So let's say I've  amassed a collective of talented and up and coming artists hell bent on  making the world weirder. Here's what I'm thinking, tell me if this is  stupid.

As part of our cult  initiation program, we put candidates through a crypto literacy program.  Get them setup with wallets, tips on safely storing, and how to get paid for art through crypto . A portion of each transaction  goes into a sort of shared crypto investment account. We use smart contracts to pay out a  percentage of any growth automatically (each participant paid a relative  % based on how much they've put into the pot) when it hits a certain  percentage of growth. Basically like rewards on a credit card, except  there's no limits on number of payouts.

There's  two reasons I like this concept. 1: It sort of mathematically codifies our ethos of  ""We all do better when we all do better"" and 2: It essentially makes us  our own bank without adding any operational overhead.

  
Idk, crazy? Would bitcoin be the most sensible coin to store the pot in? Could Ethereum 2.0 execute this sort of contract? Is any of this remotely possible? I'm pretty new to crypto, if ya'll have any helpful links to where I could learn about this myself, I'd appreciate that too. Thanks!",1626715061,dreamingmountain,True,1,2,2021-07-20

Hello,

I and a relative are looking into a multi-sig setup for our holdings. I have 3 Nano S wallets, but no subscription service yet such as Casa. If I signup for Casa, can we use that one account and my 3 devices to store both of our BTC in separate wallets? Or, do we need to purchase additional hardware and a second Casa account.

Assuming what I'm asking is possible, could my relative buy an extra Nano S and use two of my devices + his own for his security setup? So for instance, my multi-sig would be device #s 1, 2, and 3, his would be device #s 1,2, and 4.

Bitcoin,Lightning Network limitations (the case for PoS update),"The lightning network still has severe limitations. The fees are still significant.

To open a channel, the receiver needs a collateral (say, $100). When this collateral is exhausted, you need to commit a transaction to the blockchain. With fees being high, that would still be way too high for day-to-day payments; remember that fees are multiplied by the number of asymmetric hops as well.

In terms of volume, there is still a requirement of about one transaction on the main chain per channel opening, i.e. payment processor setup (per collateral allocation time). Bitcoin supports at most about 400k transactions per day -- if every channel lasts about 1 year (very optimistic), only about 140 million users, **absolute max**, can use Lightning.

Other cryptocurrencies (like Eth) use both Proof of Stake to keep costs low, as well as sharding to enable high scalability of main chain. This means 2nd layer (or even other currencies) integrate well with low fees into the mainnet.

The largest problem with BTC is not this however. It's simply that PoW energy usage is too large. We're using far too much energy, and it's not necessary at all. PoS concerns amount to pretty much FUD (fear, uncertainty doubt) because there are proven PoS chains for a while now (I suspect there were far more attacks on PoW chains than PoS). It's criticized by people that don't understand the self-stability of the system, just like no one really understood how reliable Bitcoin can be at the start. Satoshi and original founders never spoke against PoS -- they simply didn't even consider this could be an option. In light of this PoW doesn't make sense.

As I see it, there are only two options for BTC:

(1) Switch to PoS

(2) Become obsolete

---

( (3) is Burn the World. Please don't. )

Bitcoin,"Hey Friends! I made a video on how you can earn a passive income using your bitcoin, check it out if you're interested :)","Hey friends! First up, I would like to mention that majority of your bitcoin should be in a cold hardware wallet and NOT in the following methods which will earn you passive income. However, if you would like to earn some passive income using bitcoin/crypto currency and are accepting of the risks - I made a [video](https://youtu.be/WrWIt71vlsU) explaining how to. I always wished to be able to live of my crypto and I have finally reached that point, I hope to be able to help you in your journey as well. If you like to read instead, then I have written a guide here. Nevertheless, please take good care of yourself in this current climate :)

 1. Lending Platforms 

Lending platforms are lending services that offer deposits and loans on both centralised and decentralised platforms. Essentially, as a crypto holder, you will deposit your crypto onto these platforms and earn an interest on those crypto funds that you deposited. It's pretty similar to how a bank works. These services will hold our crypto and lend it out in order to generate interest  and this interest is then paid back to us on a regular or even daily basis. With most lending platforms, you do not have to deposit your cryptocurrency for a fixed period of time, in fact you have access to your funds at any point in time should you require to utilise your crypto. In addition,  many of these platforms provide insurance to the funds that you deposit making it one of the safest ways to make passive income. To sum it up, the beauty of lending platforms are that they allow your money to compound daily with minimal risk whilst giving you 24/7 access to your crypto funds.  

 2. Staking Coins (NOT RELEVANT TO BTC)

Coin staking is the action of staking your coins in order to help maintain the decentralised consensus on proof of stake blockchains. It's kind of like being a miner in a POW blockchain such as bitcoin. But in bitcoin - miners compete with their computing power, in proof of stake block chains - people compete with the amount of coins they stake. The more coins one stake, the higher the probability of being chosen to validate a node. When you stake a coin, you earn a a decent return of your coin in kind and you also help to secure the network of the coin you are bullish on. There are a number of things you have to consider: 

\- Wallet Support - Staking complexity - Duration of lockup  - Staking returns

 Different coins have different staking parameters. 

  3.Liquidity Mining/Yield Farming 

Liquidity mining It is the practice of supplying liquidity to a protocol which is then used in order to facilitate the decentralised exchange of different assets. The transaction fees exchange users pay in exchanging the two coins is then distributed among liquidity providers based on the proportion of liquidity they provide. Some examples of such DEXES are Uniswap and Sushiswap. However, the risk of liquidity mining is impermanent loss. Impermanent loss is the quantified opportunity cost of providing liquidity should one of the tokens become volatile in price.  For Yield Farming I recommend Yearn finance - an app which automates the process by sending your crypto currency to different platforms in order to earn the highest return possible.

Swiss company seeks to create a new standard,"In the middle of the digital age and in the midst of the rise of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC), most operations to acquire products or services are carried out through mobile wallets, computers connected to the Internet or using credit or debit cards.

This reality is what the Swiss company SMD Security Printing S√†rl seeks to change with its Icynote brand. It is a kind of cool bitcoin wallet in the form of paper money that resembles banknotes traditional. In theory, anyone could load funds onto the bill and pay with it at establishments that accept BTC.

In addition, any business or trade that accepts bitcoin as a form of payment could use the banknote as a wallet and receive funds directly from its customers.

Bitcoin,Bought dr**s with my dad yesterday," 

It was an amazing day yesterday. I first told my dad (an older boomer) about crypto curriencies in 2016. He thought they were full of shit, only used to buy dr\*gs on the internet, and for other illicit ventures. He wanted nothing to do with them.

Fast forward to 2021 and my dad is taking pain relief meds that you can't get in the US. Not that I condone any of it - but they make him feel better and he's tried just about every other option and is tired of seeing new doctors every week.

Yesterday, since his friend that he usually buys from is out of town, my dad managed to find what he was looking for online - but the only accepted payment was with BTC or LTC. So he calls me for help and within 5 minutes of sitting with him I've sent 12 LTC to a wallet, recieved a confirmation email on the purchase, and a shipping notification for when he can expect his order. (used LTC because no way was I giving up any of my BTC).

The look on his face was priceless and I've now set him up with a wallet of his own as well as taught him how to use the feautes, what different coins do, and how to check his transactions on the blockchain.

I'm working on an app that provides insights into different coins. Its aim is to alert users when certain coins are on the rise. We're currently in the BETA phase of our validation tests. I'm looking for some users I can showcase the app to and get their feedback.

Here's a snapshot of the apps functionality and result below:

Both graphs are portrayed between the dates of 13/07/2021 - 18/07/2021 at day intervals.  Off G2 our system alerts us on the 13/07/2021 that HEX is on the rise. From G1 on the 13/07/2021 its value in USD is $0.086. By the 18/07/2021 HEX is valued at $0.173 equating to approximately 100% increase. At that point any investments made during G2 first alerts wouldve effectively doubled the users HEX investment.

Bitcoin,The good old days: I‚Äôm Kevin and I'm the guy who bought 259684 BTC for $2613 yesterday,""" I was watching, like many of you, a gigantic sell order burning through  the bids. Mt Gox doesn't execute trades very quickly, so we were  watching this huge order slowly eat up every buy order on the books. The  price started at around $17.50, and within minutes was below $10. At  this point, I realized this wasn't merely a large seller willing to  accept some losses. This was someone attempting to crash the market by  selling a huge percentage of the market's total bitcoins at once.

I  had around $3000 USD in my Mt Gox account, from earlier sales I'd made.  I looked at the market stats, and realized that there were tons of  orders to buy BTC at $0.01 that would likely eat up any remaining  bitcoins this seller had on the order. I figured if I put a buy order in  for $0.0101, my order would execute first and I could buy a huge amount  of bitcoins from this seller before it hit the bottom. The only problem  was that Mt Gox was running slower than molasses at the time, and  everyone was saying that it wasn't accepting trades. I had to try  several times, but eventually I got a buy order in, offering to buy as  many bitcoins as I could for $0.0101.

The site stopped responding  completely for a while, probably from so many people hitting refresh to  see what was going on. When I got back in, I saw in my account:

06/19/11 17:51¬† Bought BTC¬† 259684.77 for 0.0101

I  had just purchased over 250,000 bitcoins for $2613. At the trading  price immediately before this large sell order happened, that number  would have been worth nearly $5 million. After I regained my breath, I  tried to figure out what to do. I wasn't sure what was really going on.  Over the past few days there had been a lot of talk and complaints about  Mt Gox's security. Lists of Mt Gox usernames, email addresses and  encrypted passwords were being traded around, which was an obvious sign  that security at Mt Gox had been breached in some way. If there was an  attacker in the system, perhaps he was able to log into my account now  and force my account to execute some other crazy trade. ""

Bitcoin,How much Bitcoin can make you rich?,"I think you have seen what Hal Finney has written in an article. He said if everything goes right each Bitcoin would be worth $10,000,000.

Bitcoin price is now at $31,754

If you want to be a millionaire, you just need 0.1 Bitcoin.

At the current price, the cost of acquiring 0.1 Bitcoin is $3,754. 

Even if we assume each Bitcoin at $1,000,000 in the next five years, you can DCA as the price may touch $25,000 this year.

So you can get one Bitcoin anywhere between $25,000 and $30,000.

How long does it take you to earn $25,000? So that you don't have to worry next five years",1626671676,akshaykmvlly,True,1,37,2021-07-19

2.- I moved the crypto to my cold wallet.

My question is  if I use my cold wallet to pay for the VPN it is still tracking back that it is me?.

Bitcoin,I think I get it after a few drinks,"1. Bitcoin is the first digital object that can't be duplicated or forged

2. The way Bitcoin was created is almost as important as Bitcoin. Anonymous creator, no financial incentive, open-source for anyone to use, had $0 value for a year. It's like humans discovering gold for the first time

3. Any Bitcoin fork is a waste of time. Imagine if the creator of the universe could create a knock off gold at any time and put it in the ground for us. For value, we seek items that have rare properties. meanwhile Satoshi created the scarcest asset known to mankind.

4. Not even one of the largest countries could cripple Bitcoin. 

5. There's **way** smarter people than me that already understand this and are doing everything they can to accumulate as much as possible via manupulation.  It feels like just yesterday I bought the dip at $3,000. This thing is going into the millions.

However. Now's everything gone. **My question is: Does** [**blockchain.com**](https://blockchain.com) **refund all the stolen funds, so the unrecognized transactions, which were NOT attempted by me?**

And also: I've NEVER shared my accounts to anyone! Some of my account data were found in a databreach. Never expected, that all additional security activities were bypassed. ‚Äî Honestly!

Bitcoin,Take a proper care of your mental health. It‚Äôs far more valuable than anything else," 

I know, another post about the mental health but hear me out, please.

As most of you already know, we‚Äôre living in a society that values money. We will do many things for it and sometimes it may result in sacrificing our mental health. This can be a subversive process that is hard to catch in the moment. The absolute paradox of value and money is that the very thing you chase can be the thing that destroys you. Unfortunately, I have chased money on several occasions and in parallel sacrificed relationships, time and most importantly, my mental health. I've lost sleep, jeopardized relationships and undermined my own ethics far too many times to count. Although my relationship with money has evolved, in my early days I was specifically obsessed about these 3 things:

1. Not having enough
2. My friends doing better than me
3. Others doing better than me

I also started asking these questions:

1. Do I lose sleep over my crypto positions? (Yes)
2. Can I go a day without checking the market? (No)
3. How do I feel when I lose? (Like shit, of course, what did you expect)

I realized I have a big problem. My investing habits were destroying my life. After weeks of thinking I came up with these points to get me back on track:

1. Staying away from social media or at least reducing it by a wide margin
2. Not reading news in the evenings before bed
3. Leaving my phone in another room when I went to sleep.
4. Taking at least 1 full day per week totally away from all screens, phone, laptop, desktop and otherwise and hitting the mountains
5. Trading far less. When I trade less and look at the screen less, I tend to make more money.

Right now, I‚Äôm doing way better and I‚Äôm really thankful for that. I hope some of you might find it useful. Success has nothing to do with how much money you have, it's about the relationship you have with money, people and yourself. If you become paranoid and build a shelter based on fear and obsession - even if you get rich financially you will be the most depressed person alive.

Good luck out there!",1626643254,Argentino_Feliz,True,1,22,2021-07-19

Bitcoin,I am 100% convinced of $100k BTC this year," 

I have Glassnode subscription. I have been following the on chain metrics since the dip in May. I am comparing both on chain and the charts of the current sideways market to previous long bear markets and consolidation markets aka crab market.

At first in May, there was a lot of negative metrics like miners capitulation, whale and retail capitulation.

But since the middle of June, miners are accumulating, whales are accumulating, only retail is mostly selling but also the number of wallets keeps trending up. In long bear markets, this will not happen.

The current situation looks exactly the same as the middle part of 2013 and 2017. Some boring months and then suddenly the mother of all bull runs out of nowhere.

Remember that BTC was 2.5k around June-July in 2017. You wouldn't have believed it would hit 20k by December back then either. 2013 same story with a lot of sideways during middle of the year.

First it was Elon FUD. Then in the last 3 to 4 weeks, Bitcoin has overcome being banned by the world's most populated country. It only made a slight impact on price. Difficulty adjusted and now miners are relocating and coming back online with renewables.

Remember China also banned Bitcoin in the middle of 2017. These attacks never work on Bitcoin. It always makes Bitcoin stronger, so expect a raging bull run to start soon.

Bitcoin history shows that dip buyers have always won. Dip sellers just end up buying at higher price. So take your opportunity or you will regret later.

In 2013, BTC started in 3 figures and reached 4 figures.

In 2017, BTC started in 4 figures and reached 5 figures.

In 2021, BTC started in 5 figures and will reach 6 figures.

It's like clockwork. A mathematical miracle!

Bitcoin,"You hear about Lightning all the time, but did you ever use it? Just do it. It proves bitcoin is already able to be the world's payment network.","It's easy to become skeptical of pronouncements about massive new developments that are caveated with ""and the real world applications will get there eventually.""  For example, the Lightning Network as secure off-chain settlement to solve Bitcoin's scaleability. Always sounded reasonable, but many, many years have passed since initial proposals and nothing ever seemed here or stable.

Someone tipped me with lnbot the other day for a comment posted, and I thought as knowledgable as I've been about bitcoin for a long time, I have no idea how to claim something that is legitimately built on the bitcoin network.

So I do a little investigating for a Lightning compatible wallet. Critical for me is:

* open source
* non-custodial

Came across the usual lists of recommended wallets and dug deeper into Muun.  I am blown away.  Not only does it meet those two criteria, it's just simple, fast, and does exactly what I didn't think would be possible with LN - it makes it so you *don't have to think about it*.

I click ""Receive"", I click ""Lightning"" and just like any bitcoin transaction, you get a QR code and I withdrew my sats from the lntipbot. That's cool and all but what's important is how can someone get their on-chain bitcoin onto Lightning, so it's ready for its actual use case of buying coffee and whatnot.  I have to set up a channel right? Or find someone to open a channel with? I have to manage how long the channel's open? Invoices? Eh? Bitcoin's simplicity vanishes... but no!

Muun's whole philosophy is you get **one** balance. So I hit ""Receive"", then ""Bitcoin"", then I send like $10 worth to it. Now suddenly, my Muun wallet has a balance of the tip from before and the btc I just sent, no distinction. I don't know what's on chain, off chain, but **it doesn't matter**! 

I then hit ""Send"", ""Lightning"" and deposit $5 into the Reddit lntipbot. It works! I definitely didn't have $5 of LN balance, but it sends instantly all the same.

*This is how it's meant to be.* The security, distributed protection, and rigid scarcity of Bitcoin, but versatility to handle microtransactions globally. The only reason bitcoin is not every country's default currency is people's ignorance and the intentional or unintentional misinformation spewed by those with power to lose. 

It's worked since 2008. It works even better now. The technology is here. You don't need complex custodial financial constructs like ETFs and derivatives to own it as an investment and you don't need 1,000s of other pointless cryptos to use it for small payments. Try Muun or some other Lightning wallet and start using it. This just feels game changing, and it shouldn't have taken me getting a Reddit tip to figure that out.",1626637268,rgnet1,True,1,221,2021-07-19

Bitcoin,Oklo and Compass to Launch advanced Fission-Powered Bitcoin Mining. Generating 150 megawatts of renewable energy.,"Compass Mining, the world‚Äôs first online marketplace for Bitcoin mining hardware and hosting, has announced a 20-year commercial partnership with Oklo Inc., a California-based company that develops renewable energy facilities.

Oklo stated that its advanced fission reactors will be able to start supplying clean energy sometime in the early 2020s. In the first phase of the 20-year collaboration, Oklo intends to provide Compass with at least 150 megawatts of renewable energy.

Oklo is part of a wave of companies developing smaller reactors that they say would be faster and cheaper to build than conventional nuclear plants. Such reactors could be compact and produce a lot of electricity while emitting no hazardous pollutants. Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo said,

‚ÄúWe are proud to blaze new trails on the commercialization of our powerhouses by partnering with Compass in decarbonizing Bitcoin‚Äù

Bitcoin,Are we in an Echo Chamber here? Are we ignoring what is right in front of us?,"I've been lurking this sub daily since February when I first became interested in actually investing in BTC long term (I did speculation trading in 2017...sold 3 BTC at below 3k). Anyways, I purchased $800 or so dollars worth the week before the steep price drop began to occur this yeat. I've DCA'd down to average it out but there are many more variables now, it seems, than there were in February that seem to be mentioned but their impacts ignored:

-Chinese ban..this time it looks like for good. They want their own centralized controlled digital currency to coexist and eventually take over the yuan. I have graduate degrees in Chinese Political Economy and there was NO WAY BTC was going to be allowed to thrive there. Mining for a time; Yes. It benefited the central government. When the population gets involved and starts gaining interest in obtaining and using a currency they have (the possibility) of no control over-it's game over for BTC in the PRC. 

-The US issuing it's own coin (USDT if I remember correctly), tied tot he US dollar with very little variation from it. Maybe 0.01 on a bad day. 

-Bukele in El Salvador will simply use the infrastructure of BTC to make their own state-controlled coin, just like the United States and China. I see comments here like ""the IMF got to him,"" or that ""he bowed down to international pressure."" No, he simply 1) will now will have a currency in which is controlled by the central government, which power resides primarily in Bukele. 2) I wonder who is going to own the exchanges and wallets that the coin works through? You all are rooting for a Trump-like populist figure. Many of you want to be long-term thinkers when it comes to the advancement of the abolishment of FIAT but willing to skip the steps necessary for the dream to come true. Look at examples of the 20th century and ""skipping steps"" and you'll notice a trend. It didn't work. 

-So called ""whales"" and accounts that control the most BTC, especially exchanges and now major banks control the most BTC at the moment. Only a finite amount of BTC can ever be mined. There is ALREADY a wealth disparity occurring. You think the BTC millionaires/billionaires who held since 2009/11 are here en-masse posting? I think I read a figure here that the average BTC ""HODLER"" here has about $1000 invested. Those who purchased in 2009-2017 are set. They can sell all their BTC now and make enormous profits. Newcomers, not so much, hence your interest in posting here. You have an interest, a need, for the price to go up in order to reclaim your FIAT investment, disavowing the point of BTC in general.

-Many on this site aren't even necessarily concerned with BTC's current ties to USD. That you believe in the political and financial statement BTC is trying to make. That's good, and honestly I agree with you folks. I so very much that dream would come through. But at the current rate I forecast it's just not happening. 

From my undergraduate and graduate degrees in relevant fields, I will tell you that governments WILL NOT ALLOW A CURRENCY TO BE DECENTRALIZED AND OUT OF THEIR CONTROL. They will shove FUD so far up your sphincter or put regulations in place (that benefit the wealthy and hurt the middle and lower classes) that that it comes out of your mouth. When the price dropped in February and March, all I read was ""HODL, HODL, HODL,"" though I don't quite see that anymore. People get excited if BTC maintains $34k for a day at this point in time. 

-This is all just my opinion and my own speculation that I've noticed and recognized from the past, both in dealing with BTC and in dealing with a major change in currencies. I think some more members of this sub should perhaps think about other sides of the coin and reevaluate your position on BTC, or atleast take a step back and become unattached for a moment to see the possible realities ahhead.
     
- I'm by no means an expert. Hell, I HOPE BTC hits 50, 100k by the end the year or so as I am holding a certain amount in cold storage, but I also am not blind to the realities surrounding it. My belief is BTC will not see a demand that warrants a 100k price point, The FUD I mentioned will be too great. FOX and CNN will deem BTC ""Buying the Crack"" or some stupid shit like that. Just, please, at the moment be smart, only invest in what you can REALLY afford to lose, and look at the variables presented right in front of you. States take action to increase power and wealth, and BTC goes against that, I think the world economy &amp; states involved in that economy are a great deal stronger than a single Cryptocurrency.

PS: Due to work and family I probably won‚Äôt respond to posts, at least for awhile. Feel free to rip it apart and posts your opinions- I think that this is what this sub is all about; hopefully in a respectful manner and discussion.",1626631063,Xmrtrader0101,True,1,29,2021-07-19

I think that if BTC mining process follows a first-seen-first-safe transaction mechanism with 0-conf, the transaction fee and waiting times can be brought down significantly than what it is today. 0-conf alone is dangerous but think if your payment becomes irreversible then you need not rely on confirmation if you make a payment to a merchant and that payment will become instantaneous (which will be confirmed at a later point of time, but due to irreversibility, is a hundred percent reliable payment with negligible chances of double spending).

Bitcoin,Is 10 minutes really that bad?,"I was a member of an online/ app-based bank for 5 years. I loved them! Then they were bought out by a new bank and the old bank accounts were converted over and the old app was EOL‚Äôed. The new (X) bank and their app sucks (IMO), so I decided to switch to a different (Y) bank. I opened up an account with said different (Y) bank at the beginning of the month. A week later I started the transfer. X bank is headquartered in Alabama, and Y bank is HQ‚Äôed in Michigan. I thought transferring my money would be easy, but immediately I had problems. Bank X had a $10,000/day limit to ACH push money to an external bank, but luckily Y bank has no limit to ACH pull money into my account.

On a Friday morning at 10am I tried to initiate a transfer of my funds from X to Y, but I could not select the current Friday to initiate the transfer. I had to choose the following Monday to initiate the transfer! On Monday the funds disappeared from my X bank account and I received confirmation of the funds in my Y bank on the next Thursday. This whole process too a week!

I realize waiting 10, 20, or 30 minutes to get into the next few blocks can be frustrating, and people bemoan their transactions taking so long when we just want to click a button and have instant confirmation.

I am working on trying to create an accurate visual portrait of Bitcoin by breaking it up into its smaller systems. As I read and think through the currency I get a mental image from the various concepts, and I try to capture them while I can see it in my mind‚Äôs eye.

Bitcoin,Is this true? Can it be debunked?,"Saw this in another sub. Would like to hear some truth about it:



Core has rigged the game the same way legacy has.

By instituting a fee market with the blocksize cap they have effectively gamed the network to be a positive feedback loop.

1.	‚Å†‚Å†create fee market (institute blocksize cap, had nothing to do with tech capabilities really)
2.	‚Å†‚Å†fee market creates competition for transactions thus increasing the price of fees
3.	‚Å†‚Å†higher fees ensures hashpower on desired chain
4.	‚Å†‚Å†higher hashpower = more security. investors will always choose highest security to store value (hence the store of value narrative and the HODL narrative that decreases liquidity)
5.	‚Å†‚Å†more money flows into Core chain and causes fees to scale up with it therefore creating the positive feedback loop of rising fees and investment.

If you follow this logic to its end it will cause Core chain to become so expensive to spend on that only the largest institutions (governments and central banks) capable of using it. Sound familiar right? Then another transactional layer (FEDcoin, LN is a red herring) instituted for plebs to use that will be fully transparent and controllable (if you aren't using your money in an approved manner you are disciplined like Chinas Sesame Credit) by the USG and any other entity that has the access.

Edit: I should also mention that I have a suspicion that the Chinese miners were spamming the network to force legit transaction to carry fees. This would mean the miners are incentivized to not act in the best interest of the network as a whole so all of the Core model is fundamentally broken by the fee market.",1626624678,Odbdb,True,1,20,2021-07-19

Bitcoin,A question I have to ask: Are we witness that Josph Schumpert's idea of ‚Äúcreative destruction‚Äù is valid and so blockchain technology makes our traditional banking system obsolete?,"  

A name that should not be missing when we talk about today's finance world is Joseph Schumpert, who was through and through fascist. He shaped many generations of economists, bankers and related investment strategies. One often hears the name Karl Marx or Adam Smith, but for the conservative financial world, Schumpert's main work, which is based on Marx's ideas, ""Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy"" (first published in 1942) laid one of the cornerstones of today's financial world, with the crazy idea of ‚Äú‚Äã‚Äãcreative destruction‚Äù ‚Äì  a process of industrial mutation that continuously revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. The book is much more than a prognosis of capitalism‚Äôs future. It is also an overambitious defense of capitalism on the grounds that capitalism sparks entrepreneurship. It is the third most cited book in the social sciences published before 1950, behind Marx's Capital and The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith. Currently, on google scholar, he is top 4 of cited economic researcher.

Even Schumpert was a crazy bastard in his ideas about how capitalism is and should be organised in our society, he believed that capitalism would be destroyed by its successes, as he starts in his prologue ‚ÄúCan capitalism survive? No. I do not think it can. ""

To come back to the crypto world, my question is: Will and can blockchain technology change our economic system, to a fair spread of wealth in this world, or to fetch and carry capitalism as we have it now?

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Is The Future," 

I'll share a brief story for my readers so that they can learn from it and not make the same mistakes that I almost made, which I feel is the single biggest risk in crypto. I recently got a new phone, and of course, traded my old phone in for 100 bucks or whatever they gave me. What I didn't realize is that my 2-factor authentication was tied to the old phone, so when I went to log into my BlockFi account after having a couple of glasses of wine, I couldn't get into my account. I tried the Google Authenticator with the new phone and my Google account, but Google gave me an error message when I did that. I had to use the recovery key that they gave me when I set up my account. I'm in. No big deal, right? Before it logs me in, something pops up with another recovery key, which I can't really tell if it's the same or not. I take a picture of it to be safe. The next time I log into my account, I realize that the old recovery key did not work and that me taking a picture may have been the only thing that saved me from losing all of my crypto. I withdrew all of my crypto from BlockFi after this and put it in the exchange-traded Grayscale Trust  at a discount to NAV to avoid becoming a statistic.

I don't know for sure whether I would have been able to get my crypto back or not. I've had friends lose hundreds of thousands of dollars of crypto by losing their keys to it. There's a guy in the UK [who accidentally threw out](https://www.thecryptocapital.com) over $250 million in Bitcoin. *The New York Times* [profiled a programmer](https://thecryptocapital.com) in San Francisco who lost over $200 million in Bitcoin as well. In the second case, the guy simply doesn't remember the password. There are two sides to this argument, the first that when other people lose the keys to their currency that it benefits everyone else, and the second is that if it could happen to you it's a ridiculous risk. In the end, maybe the biggest risk of investing in Bitcoin isn't that the price crashes, but that something happens to you or you forget your password and lose all your money into cyberspace. If anyone here has lost Bitcoin and is willing to share, please share your story in the comments, I believe my readers would benefit from your experience!",1626616574,Realistic_Station_89,True,1,8,2021-07-18

I'm from Zimbabwe (yes the country with trillion dollar notes). And it's no secrete we have a corrupt and dictatorship government here.our currency is worthless and as Zimbabweans we cannot shop online as our gvt won't have foreign currency to pay out of Zim. So here is my questions

1). Is there a way our government can just Create a cryptocurrency exchange and just adopt bitcoin as main currency. That way at least we can buy stuff online using bitcoin and they still get their tax as they include it in transaction charges.

2). Is there a way an exchange can be created and run in Zimbabwe but be registered with a foreign bank. That way our government will not have control. For instance, can a Mexican buy crypto and pay for it at an American bank.

#### Mass control and mass surveillance are the real truth and goal behind theses very dangerous measures, every smart person know that.Further on, we are stepping in a total and global digitalised world.Where everything is controlled by and from the technology :

#### QR code, banking system, security system and so on ‚Ä¶Digital euros and other governments cryptocurrencies are in development and soon will be implemented, cash will soon disappear.This is our 2.0 golden handcuffs where everything will be traced and controlled by the power in place.Privacy is one of biggest right and freedom that any human being on the planet should have.

#### Quick exemple :When you are having sex with your partner you are closing your windows not because you have to hide something or you are doing something wrong but just because you are protecting your privacy.

#### Privacy is freedom.

Now ask yourself : How can we fight back? How can we take back our power and freedom? not everyone is a developer or hacker, not everyone can bypass this high-technology and the power in place by themselves.

**The solution :** First we have to look at the root of all problems : the financial banking system.

PRINTING ILLIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY and bailing up only the big players, leaving the real economy in the dust, is the main factor that keeps this corrupted power in place.As we all know on this planet there is always a cure for any disease and yes this is a disease !

The cure is cryptocurrency technology, and we are now certain that it‚Äôs the most powerful and efficient threat to the entire global financial world order.

We are still in its early days and we don‚Äôt have yet it‚Äôs full potential deployed but we can see already how it affect the central banks, having them stating multiple time that they have to urgently regulate cryptocurrencies markets or they will lose their sovereignty.

Some of you are waking up and some resistance groups are forming, and especially the Mechanics of the future team which are one of the leader in the matter. Developing a complete anonymous cryptocurrency ecosystem will place every holder and users into a special untouchable position. 

By joining our forces throughout the network of nodes of the upcoming IPRO blockchain of Insider protocol, based on the mimble wimble protocol, we will be able to give birth the most unstoppable cryptocurrency ecosystem on the market. And by this mean building our safe zone where anyone will be able to take back their freedom and mostly their financial freedom.The more you're going to be using decentralized cryptocurrency ecosystem the more we are all going make the old banking financial system disappear, and the more we will take back our power and freedom

I bought bitcoin in 2019, below $10k. When it peaked near $60k I sold a third of it making some nice profit and put this money into some less volatile assets.

At the time of writing, I basically have bitcoin risk free as the initial investment has been taken out of the markets, plus profits, now I just got a bank loan (roughly $25k) which I'll pay in 5 years at 6.8% interest rate. I figured, I'll have this BTC on blockfi getting ~5-6% and getting more BTC with very low risk, if BTC goes south, I have enough money to pay back the loan and liquidate my position.

Bitcoin,Can someone here verify if the gamestop wallet is legit?,"**Background:** Apparently you can mine crypto eth/btc... for the gamestop GME wallet. This would give me confidence that gamestop actually have an active coin in their NFT wallet and their plan is to either have crypto based transactions or provide potentially crpyto stock dividends (the latter would be good for both crpyto and gme longterm). I was thinking this would be the best subreddit to ask, as someone would potentially be a miner to verify. Please let me know if this isn't the case.

I'm not a miner and wanted to verify what the user said in this post I've linked below is legit.

Bitcoin,Does the difficulty adjustment pro-rate corrections?,"Hi all,
Given the recent difficulty rate adjustment, I realized I didn‚Äôt quite understand something. It will be hard to articulate, but here it goes. 

When the difficulty rate adjustment happens, does it compensate for the previous periods slow or fast blocks?

For example, if for 2 weeks we are solving blocks only every 20 minutes, then we are behind schedule 50% on blocks (extreme example). Does the difficulty adjustment factor this in, and set us up with a new schedule that will bring us to where we SHOULD have been? Or does it just shoot for 10 minute blocks, and hope that the behind schedule periods and the ahead of schedule periods even out?

Part of my concern in asking is because we almost always, until recently, see difficulty adjustments increase‚Ä¶ meaning that without a prorated correction mechanism, we would consistently be ahead of schedule‚Ä¶.?

I suppose I could do the math and figure it out for myself, but I wanted to see if anyone knows.",1626584843,1entreprenewer,True,1,6,2021-07-18

Bitcoin,Up to $2300 worth of stocks! Limited time Webull promotion,"This promotion is a no brainer for everyone out there interested in more buying power to buy more crypto on the dip!

Webull is a SEC registered, SIPC insured broker (up to $500,000 in securities insurance), known for being the biggest competitor to Robinhood and one of the biggest investing apps in the app store. They have awesome features and a really beautiful app/user interface. I would highly recommend this app to everyone interested in investing. They blow Robinhood out of the water in every single way possible.

They have a limited time promotion going on right now: Register an account with the link below and get 2 stocks worth up to $2300.

For the first stock, you don't need to do anything. Just create an account. To claim the second stock, you need to deposit $5 into the account. Once funds are settled, you can claim the stock.

If you're not interested in investing, i'd still recommend signing up just for the cash. You don't even have to use their app, you can just sell whatever stocks you get from the promotion when the stock market is open during the week and transfer the money back to your account. And then spend with whatever you want, or transfer the money to your brokerage of choice.

Bitcoin,"About Jack Dorsey building a Bitcoin ""defi"" platform. How would it work? Is it competition for Ethereum?"," 

Bitcoin doesn't have ERC20 tokens or a programming language like Solidity, so the backend isn't going to be the same as ETH defi. However, I do believe you can create decentralized financial applications for bitcoin that on the frontend function the same for the users as ETH defi. It's going to be engineered with a different design philosophy and more centralized/decentralized in some areas, but accomplish the same goal for the user.

As we know, the weak point of Ethereum right now is the network fees, and I think Jack Dorsey is trying to hit Ethereum where it hurts. With the lightning network bitcoin fees are reduced to near 0. Another weak point for Ethereum Defi is user interface. If Jack Dorsey can build a platform with a more friendly and easy user experience, I could imagine Bitcoin Defi stealing some of Ethereum's thunder.",1626559511,ShotBot,True,1,68,2021-07-18

If there will only be 21 million EVER and some will be prone to loss (and assuming the species keeps growing) will less than 21 million be enough for 10/15/20 billion humans? Will another unit smaller than the Satoshi eventually be needed? If so, is that akin to devalue or debasement?

And that bad actor can stay undetected at least for some time. But.....

If s/he changes that old transaction, *and* then is able to find right hash for the new block before everyone else, *and* can then ""force"" a consensus on the network (because s/he controls &gt;50% of compute power) the fraud will *still be plain obvious* to a minority of ""behaving"" nodes on the network. 

Because by the very nature of SHA256 algorithm, the hash of the last block in the chain (before the above 51% attack took place) will have suddenly changed too.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Maxi Needing Some Help,"So as the title states, I am looking for the options of you all to help me in this situation. 

I (27M) have been a Bitcoin maximalist for quite some time and I feel like I truly understand the value Bitcoin and and will continue to play in our world. I feel so strongly about Bitcoin, because I have put in so much time and effort through the years learning. 

Recently, my sister (23F) came to me asking for some assistance with investing her money. She has been stacking cash and has created a great nest egg to get her started thanks to her efforts of working hard and saving. 

To give a bit of background. Our father is a financial advisor and because I have always took an interest in it, we have always spoke about it and I have learned a lot through him. My sister was never really interested or seemed to care. All she wanted was the cash sitting in her shoebox. With everything going on my dad and I speak about BTC alot.. like to the point my sister gets annoyed about it. 

We truly believe it is the best place to put your cash long term for the future with the best returns with the least risk.. opportunity cost. 

I asked what she was thinking about investing in or how I could help. She responded with, well I'm not really sure where to start. I gave her some response to the idea that Bitcoin would be the simplest, quickest, and best way for her to allow for her money to appreciate. She of course is very turned aways by that idea because she has never cared to actually learn what Bitcoin is and it's value. 

She stated that she has been watching lots of TikTok videos on how she could buy house/real estate to do Airbnb because it's so easy and she says she can live off the income. I am unaware of her true knowledge in this area and feel like she is just getting the very bare basic information on how easy it is, but she has not thought about all the time, energy and efforts she would have with going through the real life process. In addition she is still having to pay for her own rent, which counteracts what she would be having to spend for the mortgage, fees, insurance, taxes, etc. In hopes that she would make a % difference from her costs and what she would make renting through Airbnb. In addition, her money is not liquid at all and she is taking on more unnecessary debt for the chance to make some profits with the uncertainty of the property decreasing/increasing in value.

Overall, I am unsure how I should go forward with this conversation. I would like to help her, but how would I best go about that? Our father always told us, invest in what you know and what you enjoy learning about. She has no interest in learning about Bitcoin at all, even though I believe it will be bigger than what the internet is today. I want her to think about her future and how she wants to spend her time, energy, and efforts. But, in the end, we all don't know what we don't know. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or advice on how to approach this situation? 

If you have any questions, I left out anything or you need additional info, please ask.",1626542691,charleyeeee,True,1,12,2021-07-18

Is there a problem with it or some reason people don't think this is valuable that I'm not seeing??,1626541819,infopocalypse,True,1,13,2021-07-18

Here is the transcript:

What is Bitcoin? In this video I will explain Bitcoin, from a non technical perspective.¬†

I will use easy language and examples that help you to understand everything better.¬†

Bitcoin was introduced during the financial crisis in 2008 by a group or person under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. In a 9 pages PDF document they describe how Bitcoin works, and what makes it special and important to all of us.¬†

I will not cover every detail of the so-called Whitepaper, but I will try to explain Bitcoins most important features.¬†

Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.¬†

Let us start with that. Everyone of you knows what cash is. Some of us still use it on a daily basis to purchase goods and services. We use coins and bills. Once we give our cash to someone, this cash is not in our possession anymore, and we can not give the same bills or coins to someone else. So far so good. If one person gives cash to another person, you could call it peer to peer. One peer gives cash to the other peer. Simple like that. There is no need for someone in between, a middleman, or a bank, to verify the peer to peer cash transfer from one person to another.¬†

And Bitcoin in its core is exactly this, just electronic. You can send (or transfer) Bitcoin from one person to another, just like cash. And the best is, you don‚Äôt need a middleman, for example a bank, or a company like PayPal or Visa, in order to do so. That you can do this peer to peer, electronically, is maybe the biggest and most important feature of Bitcoin. It also makes Bitcoin resistant and resilient. You don‚Äôt have to trust anyone to store your Bitcoin or run the Bitcoin network. This is one of the reasons it is often called trust-less. As there is no central authority controlling Bitcoin, Bitcoin can‚Äôt be shut down. The only way for Bitcoin to disappear is, if everyone that is running Bitcoin needs to be convinced to stop doing this. As of today, we are talking about tens of thousands of computers and companies all over the world. Together they create the decentralized peer to peer Bitcoin network. The only way to shut down Bitcoin, is to shut down the internet. And this is very unlikely to happen, especially when we are entering a time where the internet can be accessed via satellites from every corner of the earth.¬†

Access is also a very important topic for Bitcoin. As explained before the Bitcoin network is a decentralized peer to peer network without a central authority or middlemen. Everything is public at any time, every transaction, every address (often called a wallet or identity) that is used to send or receive Bitcoin. Even more important is that everyone can participate in Bitcoin without asking for permission. Think about it like a public park, everyone can enter, you don‚Äôt need to ask anyone to do so. This is why Bitcoin is also called public and permission-less. Bitcoin is for everyone, the only thing you need is an internet connection and a smartphone or computer.

The easiest way to get started with Bitcoin is getting a Bitcoin wallet. It‚Äôs like your physical wallet in your pocket, just as an app, on your smartphone or computer. Once installed, you will receive an address, and a key, usually 12-24 English words. The key is like your password, only you know it, and only with the key you can access your Bitcoin. If you lose your key, you lose your Bitcoin. If someone gets to know your key, this person can access your Bitcoin. Therefore it is advised to store the key in a very safe place and never show it to anyone. Think about it like the key to your physical Tresor. So protect it well!

You can create as many addresses as you want, it is completely free, public and permission-less, for everyone in the world, no matter if your government allow it or not, Bitcoin is literally for everyone, no one is or can be excluded, like you can‚Äôt be excluded from receiving cash from someone who stands in front of you and giving you it.¬†

If only you have the key to your wallet, you become your own bank.¬†

You have full control and ownership of your Bitcoin and no one can ever access them without your consent, or better said, without your key. If you die and don't pass the key to someone, your Bitcoin will be lost forever. Bitcoin gives you strong control and ownership but it comes hand in hand with being self responsible. There is no way to recover your Bitcoin once your key is lost or your Bitcoin has been sent to a different address.¬†

This sounds scary, but it is a very important feature of Bitcoin. Also the fact that Bitcoin transfers are non-reversible, you can‚Äôt get them back, or call someone, once sent (remember: there are no middlemen, Bitcoin is peer to peer). The fact that you can‚Äôt take back Bitcoin you sent so someone also ensures that you can‚Äôt send the same Bitcoin to multiple people. Again, think about cash. If you pass a bill to someone, you are not in possession of that bill anymore. You can not double spend it. Bitcoin can also not be double-spent. If you received it and if you own the key to your wallet, those Bitcoins are solely accessible and owned by you and not by anyone else.¬†

Bitcoin is private. No one knows who owns which address. This is why addresses are often called identities. If you want, you can create a new identity for every single transaction. You can, but you don‚Äôt have to re-use an address. This makes Bitcoin very private. If ten different people want to send you Bitcoin, you can give every single person a different address. This is how you stay anonymous and private. As Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt require any registration with your real name or passport, there is no connection to you in real life. This is one of the reasons why platforms like Wikileaks accept donations in Bitcoin, or why the dark web is using it too. Bitcoin is like cash. If you give someone cash on the street, both of you don‚Äôt have to know each other and you can still make a transaction.

But of course there is much more. First of all, there are only ever 21 Million Bitcoin in existence. Every Bitcoin can be divided into one hundred million pieces, the smallest piece of one Bitcoin is called a satoshi. One satoshi is 1/100.000.000 of a Bitcoin. To compare it with USD, one USD can be divided in 100 US cents. So 1 cent is 1/100 of a USD.

But other than USD or Euro, Bitcoin can not be created out of thin air, the total amount is fixed to 21 Million.¬†

So how can you get Bitcoin?¬†

Bitcoin can be earned by securing and running the Bitcoin network. As this part is quite technical and difficult, I will not explain it in this video.¬†

An easier way to own Bitcoin, is to exchange Bitcoin with another currency, or buy Bitcoin from someone, or get paid in Bitcoin for work, instead of getting paid in Euro for example. You can exchange Bitcoin for Euro or USD or any other currency, the same way you can exchange USD for GBP for example.¬†

Why does Bitcoin have value?

To be honest, before Bitcoin I never thought about the question why money has a specific value. I had no idea where it came from (the state? The government?) and I didn‚Äôt really care. But with more and more people calling Bitcoin an alternative to traditional cash, I became interested to learn more about it.¬†

You could say, the value of a product is defined by its importance of utility. Meaning, if a product is very useful (can be used for many things) it‚Äôs worth a lot. But that argument doesn‚Äôt hold. Life could not exist without water, but water seems to be less expensive than diamonds.¬†

Scarcity is important too. Scarcity (how many diamonds exist and how many people want them) is an important factor. Let it be a bottle of wine or a Picass√¥ painting. Marx once said, the value derived from the labour used to produce it. Growing a tomato is easier than growing a cow, so cow meat is more expensive than tomatoes.¬†

But all this didn‚Äôt really explain to me the value of Bitcoin, so I looked into the USD. The name Dollar was derived from a place that produced the first silver coins, a valley that was called Joachims-thal, the coin was called Thaler, throughout the time Thaler became Dollar. So there we go. First dollars were silver coins.¬†

With the introduction of the dollar more than 200 years ago, the dollar was basically a certificate for gold. At any time you could go to the bank (or government), give them your dollar and receive your gold. Gold was scarce back then and is scarce today. It has a high scarcity, and there is nothing more scarce than Bitcoin today (think about it, there are only ever 21 million Bitcoin!).¬†

Back to the topic. Good money (how Austrian economics called it) can not come from thin air. Why does anyone like Pablo Picasso‚Äôs paintings? And pays a certain amount of USD or Bitcoin for it. Nobody knows and it doesn‚Äôt matter. Bitcoin can easily be money. Scarcity is important, and it‚Äôs very difficult to find anything scarcer than Bitcoin.

Today, the Dollar and the Euro and basically all government issued currencies are centrally planned and controlled. At any time, governments can create money out of thin air. And there is nothing we do about it. We need money to pay for goods and services, and when the government needs money, for example to fight a pandemic, they create money.¬†

This leads to problems though. Money needs to be in balance. There can‚Äôt be free money, or everyone would take as much as they want and money would become totally worthless. Hyperinflation would start.¬†

One person that received the Nobel prize in 1974 for economics is Hayek. He described the value of money in time. There are two types of people, he said, one type that has money, one type that needs money. Someone who has a very high time preference, needs money at this very moment, to buy champagne in the club or to start a business. These people usually borrow that money from someone who has a low time preference, someone who has saved money, usually through banks. The interest they ask for is the balance between these two parties. For what percentage are you willing to lend me money? This is what Hayek received the Nobel prize for. The natural rate of interest is the balance between low and high time preferences.¬†

Today money is completely out of hand. You can borrow it for free from the bank, and there is no limit. Other than in Bitcoin, there is an unlimited number of dollars (or other fiat currencies) and this number grows at an incredible increasing speed.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/57xrjp8lyrb71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0a399b603f8ee1bbded77a76eb6684a4183088c

We have the problem that governments create money. Nearly 80% of all USD ever created, have been created in less then one and a half year. 4000 billion (21%) in 229 years, 19.200 (100%) billion dollars, 79% in the last 16 month years (Jan2020-May2021).¬†

Bitcoin is really difficult to imagine. Inflation too. We trust central authorities to not cause inflation. Bitcoin has no central authority and its supply is clearly limited and known in advance.

No more people, at any point in the history of the world, have thought about what money is. Or how central banks work, or how money is created.¬†

I don‚Äôt see the existence of fiat money and central banks as unchangeable. Bitcoin was able to educate more people on economics than any book. And we are just getting started.¬†

Bitcoin is good money. Accessible through a public and permission-less peer-to-peer network for every single person in the world. Become a Bitcoiner, continue to educate yourself, speak to others and ask questions. I promise you that you won‚Äôt regret it.

The fat cats can simply then impose a 3% tax on all bitcoin held wealth per year, and recoup precisely the same income as with money printing.

Nobody is going to revolt or mass emigrate or anything, because in this thought experiment, it would be exactly the same as now, and nobody is revolting or mass emigrating right now.

Webull is a SEC registered, SIPC insured broker (up to $500,000 in securities insurance), known for being the biggest competitor to Robinhood and one of the biggest investing apps in the app store. They have awesome features and a really beautiful app/user interface. I would highly recommend this app to everyone interested in investing. They blow Robinhood out of the water in every single way possible.

They have a limited time promotion going on right now: Register an account with the link below and get 2 stocks worth up to $2300.

For the first stock, you don't need to do anything. Just create an account. To claim the second stock, you need to deposit $5 into the account. Once funds are settled, you can claim the stock.

If you're not interested in investing, i'd still recommend signing up just for the cash. You don't even have to use their app, you can just sell whatever stocks you get from the promotion when the stock market is open during the week and transfer the money back to your account. And then spend with whatever you want, or transfer the money to your brokerage of choice.

Bitcoin,Wondering about opening wallets across different programs?,"Hi, I am not very tech savvy but I have some Bitcoin. I've had a few different wallets over the years.

Well, I want to finally get organized. I decided to just open everything using my seeds on Wasabi. Most of these were wallets I initially created and used using Electrum. So it looks like I have all my wallets recovered, and they all seem to be zeroed out except one.

That seems right to me, I'm pretty sure I moved everything into the one wallet, but I'm wondering if there's any other steps I should take to make sure I am seeing the right balance. If I just entered the seed correctly and it came up with a wallet, that's correct, right? There's nothing else I need to do?

I want to just stop using all the older wallets and get rid of the seeds connected to them, which I have written on paper copies that are currently just cluttering up my desk. Just wondering if there's anything else I have to do to make sure I am checking my balances accurately before retiring these wallets for good.

so, what if ETH gets so high in price?  the gas fee will rise up!

how we fix this problem?  


I guess, we have 3 ways

1- to make ETH at a stable price not go high too much.

2- to make gas fee fixed price not effected with ETH prices.

3- to make coin for a gas fee, also with a fixed price, not goes up.

because making the gas fee so low and stable, will improve the business.  


this is just my opinion.

Back then the hash rate was around 10 exahash, it now sits above 100 exahash. If the hash rate has increased 10x then the security has also increased 10x which means one confirmation should be as secure as six confirmations used to be.

Bitcoin,New investment opportunity in bitcoins,"  

Currently, the use of Bitcoin has spread worldwide, and it can be said that in every country in the world there are people mining this famous cryptocurrency. However, there are countries where Bitcoin is more widely used, so much so that there are companies, businesses and even ATMs to carry out transactions with this cryptocurrency. Being a currency not issued or controlled by central banks and the international banking system in general, they have been developing a campaign by all possible means with the aim of discrediting and the use of cryptocurrencies, and all because I use cryptocurrency releases those who use it from the control of banks and governments.

The operations carried out using the block chain cannot be monitored or controlled by any specific person or organization since it is a completely decentralized system. Some governments in the updated are trying without success to control the income that their citizens obtain in these currencies. Some even, like the Venezuelan government, tried unsuccessfully to create their own currency, which of course no one trusted or will ever trust. In the United States, for example, they have tried to issue regulations that force their citizens to declare their income in cryptocurrencies, since technically governments have no way of finding out this information as if it happens with their banking information. 

What is true is that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and it is indisputable that, in the near future, despite the war against them by banks and governments, their use will become more and more widespread due to the fact that each time more people are gaining confidence in them. In the race of some to get hold of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, many entrepreneurs, let's call it that, with knowledge in the world of computing, and of cryptocurrencies in general, have developed several strategies, the first and best known of which is bitcoin mining. which requires a strong investment in Hardware and is increasingly less profitable for reasons that I will not explain now. Another way to get bitcoins is simply by buying them from a friend or on an online platform that currently exists for these purposes. Another way is by trading cryptocurrencies, which consists of obtaining profits through the prediction of the price fluctuations of the different cryptocurrencies. This last way of earning cryptocurrencies requires a certain level of knowledge to perform this activity because otherwise the money used for trading operations will surely be lost. Another way and it is the one that interests us now and that can be used by anyone is making investments in sites that are dedicated to attracting micro investments with the aim of carrying out large-scale trading and / or short-term financial investments in the currency market.

The creators of these sites are teams of people who have acquired experience and knowledge in the field of finance, trading operations, and computing and cryptocurrencies in general, allowing many micro-investments to generate large amounts of capital to generate profits. which are systematically distributed among the micro investors. Sites like these are the famous Trust Investing that generates so much controversy regarding its legality and whether it is a scam, a Ponzi scheme or not. One thing is true, people invest in this site and make a profit, beyond the fact that they may not be legally well supported, which is very well understood if we remember that governments and banks systematically campaign to smear everything anything that has to do with cryptocurrencies. 

Many allege that companies such as Trust Investing are not officially registered in any specific country and if they are, it is not possible to locate their offices or representatives. But the explanation for that does not have so much to do with the business being a scam as it is the option they have as protection against actions of banking institutions and governments that are not very friendly with these types of companies. The most obvious case of this is what happened in Cuba, where one of the most recognized members of Trust Investing was arrested by government authorities on charges of illicit enrichment. In the case of Cuba, many Cubans use these platforms as a means of obtaining income that cannot be controlled or confiscated by the government that systematically works to ensure that the population remains in poverty. It is estimated that at present more than 300,000 Cubans have inerted in Trust Investing and it is generally recognized if they have received significant gains that have influenced the improvement of their living conditions.

Trust Investing is one of the most recognized sites to invest in cryptocurrencies but there are others such as Mind Capital, Mirror Trading, Arbistar, X-Toro. Personally, the writer knows of people who invest in Trust Investing and X-Toro and until now they continue to make profits. Another site that began operating since 2020 is PIETRAVERDI, which is where I am registered and so far I am doing well as well as other people I know. The site is currently officially registered in Costa Rica. I have always considered the possibility that one day the site will stop operating as can happen with any of the other sites that have been operating for several years, but by that time I will have recovered the investment I have made and thus I will not have lost anything and the most possible thing is that in fact I have already earned much more than I invested. The principle of investing in these sites is never to invest in anything that we are not willing to lose. In my case, I invested as little as possible at the beginning, which is what I always recommend. In this case in PIETRAVERDI it is 25 dollars in bitcoins, because this particular site operates only in this currency. PIETRAVERDI pays 24% per month on the amount invested, which is 1.2% daily from Monday to Friday, fixed. 300% of each package invested will be recovered. This means that if $ 25 is invested, the site will pay up to $ 75 for that investment package. The amount is recovered faster through the referral system, since for each new referral captured, the site pays the person who captured it 10% of their investment, that is, if a referral enters and on a given day buys a package of 25 dollars the one who brought it to the site will add to his recovery amount of that day of 1.2% of the package invested the 2.5 dollars corresponding to 10% of the package purchased by his referral. An important element is that registering on the site can only be done through a referral link from someone who is already registered on the site.

PIETRAVERDI also offers the possibility of recovering the investment even faster through the binary network system that consists of building a network of referrals that in turn bring more referrals, dividing the network into two parts hierarchically located below each new user who enters. to the site, so that each new user will be able to have a direct user from each side of the network underneath in the network scheme, the network being successively divided into two for each new user. The earnings per binary network will be 6% of the leg that has the least accumulated points for that day on a given day. The points are equal to the amount invested in a package, if you buy a package of 25 dollars it will be 25 points. It is therefore important not only to attract new referrals that in turn bring new referrals to expand the network more and more, but it is also important to distribute the new referrals so that the two legs of the network are balanced, since the profits 6% will be calculated, as I mentioned before, on a given day of the leg that has the fewest points on that day. Earnings from direct referrals and binary network add to the investment amount recovered and once the investment amount has been recovered, it must be invested in a new package to continue earning. Always for each package 300% will be recovered. It is possible to buy several packages and for each one, the daily 1.2 will be recovered from Monday to Friday and only one of them will be added the amount earned by direct referrals and by binary network, once 300% of a package has been recovered what was earned by referrals Direct and binary network will go to the next purchased package, if you do not buy a new package you will not be able to earn money through binary network or direct referrals and of course no interest. In addition, the maximum amount to earn daily for 1.2% plus 10% of direct referrals, plus 6% of binary network will not exceed the amount of the largest package purchased. This must be taken into account because there are users who have a very large binary network and the daily earnings are therefore significant and can reach hundreds of dollars a day, in the best cases, so it is very important to monitor their behavior and growth. of the network so that it grows in a balanced way on both legs and that the daily amount of earnings never exceeds the amount of the largest package invested because it will be losing money.

To make the first extraction from the site, which will always be to a bitcoin wallet, it will only be necessary to have a minimum of 25 dollars accumulated. I decided to invest in this site for several reasons, the first because it was highly recommended to me by people I trust and with foolproof decency. The second thing is that the site has only been running since the beginning of 2020 and these sites usually, in case of being a scam, last a few years, that is, the sites that arise with the ultimate objective of scamming their users accumulate money for a few years. 5 or 6 years, maybe more and suddenly one day they stop operating, although sometimes they start presenting problems with payment or technical problems on the site. Trust Investing, for example, has been operating for quite some time, I am not sure of the number of years, but it still pays its investors, according to some I know who invest there. In addition, after entering PIETRAVERDI the impression I have is that everything is very well organized and so far it has not stopped paying what they promise, although it has not been a long time, so the earnings are not significant yet, although other users who They entered before and they already have a more developed binary network if they have started to earn more. Finally, another aspect that I left for the end, although it is not the least important, is that normally platforms of this type are usually very sensitive to abrupt variations in the price of cryptocurrencies, even Trust Investing itself had some problems for some time during the recent fall of bitcoin, although afterwards it has continued to operate. However, PIETRAVERDI was operating normally at all times. If after reading all of the above some interest has been aroused in taking the test of investing in this new world of cryptocurrencies and you want to do it through PIETRAVERDI, you can do it through my referral link that I share below, but before you Here are some instructions that you should read well and follow to the letter: 

INITIAL REQUIREMENTS TO REGISTER PROPERLY IN PIETRAVERDI:

A) The email with which you register must always be from GMAIL. (This is very important, do not use Yahoo, Hotmail, etc).

B) Always use the PIETRAVERDI website in Portuguese, do not translate it into Spanish or English.

C) Check 5 times that your GMAIL email is well written, without fingerprints, or errors and without blank spaces before or after the field where you wrote it. If your email has an error and you start investing, it will be impossible for you to get your money out of PIETRAVERDI for security reasons. It is not possible to change the email once a user account has been created. After reading and understanding the initial mandatory requirements, you can proceed to create your username through the following link:

[https://office.pietraverdi.com/rafael77](https://office.pietraverdi.com/rafael77)

The data requested during the registration process must be the real ones, name and surname, etc.

Any questions during the process get in touch with your sponsor, that is, me in this case. Once registered, they will be able to share their own referral link to new potential investors to build their own referral network. Remember that the objective of the binary network is to attract referrals who are willing to invest, even if it is in a minimum package initially, because if a new user registers and does not invest, it is never a place in your network that will be occupied for pleasure. If a new referral invests in a minimal initial package later, they will invest more, once they are convinced that the site works and is reliable. After registering and when you decide to buy your first package, which I recommend that the first time is always the minimum, verify that when you create the user account in PIETRAVERDI, an email reaches the Gmail account that you used to register. If the email does not reach you, the registration was incorrect and you should not under any circumstances buy any investment package using that account.

To buy an investment package, you must first have a fund in bitcoins to be able to transfer bitcoins and buy the package. Remember that in bitcoin operations it is necessary to pay a transaction cost in addition to the amount to be transferred, that in some wallets it is necessary to calculate the total to be transferred by adding the amount to be transferred plus the transaction cost and in others the same It calculates the cost of the transaction separately so that you are always sure that the amount you want to transfer in bitcoins is the one that will reach the person who is transferring it. 

That said, let's move on to the operations that must be done within the PIETRAVERDI platform to buy the first package. For the purchase of PIETRAVERDI packages it is recommended to access the site through a personal computer or Laptop, since it is an easier interaction process to do the operation, it can be done through a telephone, but obviously it raises a greater difficulty. First, you access the menu called Contracts that is located in the upper left part of your user's BackOffice, once you access this option, the following is displayed: 

https://preview.redd.it/2m9fkttolnb71.jpg?width=551&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea9915fa347f93fc36b4e431f73c3a282854563d

Here it is selected, as it is the first time that a package is purchased, the minimum is 25 dollars, once selected, click on New Plan. At the bottom of the screen a new contract will be added that in status puts in open or pending. At this moment you click on the yellow button that says bitcoin that is below on the right:

https://preview.redd.it/xgdxy2hzlnb71.jpg?width=589&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2feea860842f2313a4991ef7e75db93c04dc14e9

If the site was accessed through a PC, a new window will open in the browser, displaying the following information. The following information will be displayed:

https://preview.redd.it/4pja0ya5mnb71.jpg?width=589&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0f5169959f9087d4ac1be171a3ae8fe2b86c350

At this time, the available time that is shown to perform the operation must be observed, in this case it indicates 5 hours, 46 minutes and 47 seconds, here in reality the time was 6 hours only that when the capture was made, a few minutes had already passed Normally contracts are for 4 hours, which is also sufficient time and is the time that is most frequently given to make contract payments, the time depends on the congestion of the blockchain that day. You should never accept a contract that only shows 2 hours to complete the transaction. In case of showing only two hours, exit the application and wait another day to buy the package.

One of the important data here is the wallet address that that sequence of numbers and letters that begins with 3LCN and ends with CPtW, that address is to which bitcoins must be transferred from a wallet that has funds for it, I must do the Warning that this address of the image is an example, it does not occur to anyone to transfer anything to it because they will surely lose their bitcoins. The address to which you must transfer the bitcoins is the one that will be generated at the time you are performing the purchase operation of a package. I suggest that this address is always copied from here and pasted into the wallet from which it will be extracted, verifying that the copied number is always the same as the one pasted and that there are no spaces before or after it is pasted, thus avoiding loss of money when making the transaction. The other data is the amount in Bitcoins, which as observed is 0.00211 BTC, which means that during the time that the purchase of the contract lasts, which in this example we already mentioned was 6 hours, a payment of 0.00211 BTC will be accepted and that amount will be equivalent to $ 25.

It must be guaranteed that when making the transfer, the amount of bitcoins that arrives at PIETRAVERDI is exactly the one requested in bitcoins in this case 0.00211 BTC because while the package purchase transaction is active that amount will be the equivalent of 25 dollars. The cost of the transaction in bitcoins is an additional value in bitcoins that is not included in the value to be transferred to PIETRAVERDI, my suggestion is that they use a normal operation cost that takes around 30 minutes or the priority one that owes around 10 minutes. A longer delay puts the receipt of payment for the package at PIETRAVERDI at risk. I recommend using the Mycelium wallet. 

 The contract screen should not be closed until it is confirmed that the package is already paid for. To verify that the package is paid without closing the contract screen, go to the initial tab of the browser and update the page, the paid contract will appear in status as paid. If it does not appear paid, the contract window should not be closed, wait and then refresh the page until the state says it is paid.

Once the contract is paid, the screen with the contract data can be closed. The initial screen will show that 75 dollars is pending payment, since 300% of the investment is recovered:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/grjjvit3snb71.jpg?width=457&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5105252eba84f627ad500942316a0e4a7a9a6e4c

Before making a money withdrawal from PIETRAVERDI you must have a minimum amount available of 25 dollars and have the financial key that can be obtained by requesting it on the PIETRAVERDI site, accessing the options that are displayed when clicking on the user with whom you accessed being inside the site.

https://preview.redd.it/n0qta14mnnb71.jpg?width=293&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51c2843293800610f95f8d5989aa7b68a03d8506

The financial key will be sent to the Gmail email with which you registered on the site. Once you have the financial key, you can make withdrawals as long as you reach the minimum of $ 25 accumulated and available to extract. To make a withdrawal of money in you go to the Financial-Take out backoffice option:

https://preview.redd.it/wlt3106rnnb71.jpg?width=566&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb5d44d1e5df63512d28d0da523f151d6cd1da34

Where it says carteira, the wallet address to which you are going to transfer the money will be pasted. You can delete a previously used address or add other addresses when making other extractions. Where it says value and confirm value, the amount to be extracted will be written and where it says Financial key, the financial key sent to your Gmail email will be written. The financial password that is sent to the Gmail email can be used every time you want to make money withdrawals from PIETRAVERDI, it is not necessary to change it. Great care must be taken not to leave spaces before or after the wallet address to be transferred. When all the data are correct, click on request service. PIETRAVERD charges 5% for each extraction transaction.

Final tips: 

Be patient, the process of assembling the binary network can take a long time, do not expect to earn a lot of money overnight. If they are patient and follow an adequate strategy of attracting referrals over time they will reap the rewards in the form of significant profits. It is also possible to earn money by making several investments thus obtaining a compound interest and accelerating the obtaining and profits. In addition, the site has additional money stimulus forms for users that attract many additional referrals to 6% of the binary network. Once they get into the business they will see that it is an excellent way to generate sustained income over time.",1626477884,billy-gage,True,1,1,2021-07-17

What's stopping somebody else from seeing the public address 12345 and either using the same (open source?) code to get the private key?

Could anyone use the paper wallet generator code to reverse engineer 12345 and create the private key to match with it? Or the script could generate 12345 and create a new private key that is VWXYZ... either way they'd be access whatever gets sent to 12345?

Bitcoin,GOLD CUP SHITPOST: El Salvador v Mexico,"Hello friends and fellow HODLers.

So, lately, there's been a lot of enthusiasm around here for El Salvador, first sovereign nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender currency. I think we should extend our support to El Salvador in their upcoming soccer match against Mexico, in the Gold Cup!

1. About the Gold Cup

What is it? It's a soccer tournament. In soccer, there is a World governing body called FIFA which oversees the rules of the game and the organization of the World Cup (and other, smaller tournaments). National Federations of soccer clubs are, of course, members of FIFA. But other important members of FIFA are regional confederations. You've probably heard of UEFA or Conmebol. UEFA organizes the Champion's League between the top clubs in Europe and the EuroCup (recently won by Italy), while Conmebol organizes the Libertadores Cup (between the top clubs in South America) and the Copa America (recently won by Argentina). Similarly, the area of North America, Central America, and the Caribbean has its own Confederation called CONCACAF. CONCACAF organizes the region's equivalent to the EuroCup or the Copa America. It's called the ""Gold Cup"", and for commercial reasons, it's always held in the United States. This is the biggest international tournament held in America that most Americans have probably never heard of.

Usually, either Mexico or the United States wins the Gold Cup, as they are the countries with the most developed soccer infrastructure in the region. However, soccer is extremely popular in other countries in Latin America, too, like Costa Rica, Honduras, and, of course, El Salvador. In fact, [in 1969, Honduras and El Salvador went to war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_War) (literal military conflict) over a soccer match! And there's no team that Central American countries compete hardest against than Mexico, who frequently called themselves 'the giant of CONCACAF', often undeservedly, and who belittles their national team and leagues. Mexico is the team to beat.

2. About the match

So, my proposal is to cheer for El Salvador as a proxy to cheering for Bitcoin. But also, let's cheer against Mexico. Why? Here are a few reasons:

a) They suck ass. They always belittle and abuse their neighbors to the south will playing victim at the treatment they get from their northern neighbor. You've heard of the migrant crisis? Those migrants are not Mexican but Central American, many of them Hondurans and Salvadorans, and where do you think they get the most abuse? Not in ICE detention, but in Mexico's INM, not to mention, of course, the Mexican cartels...  

b) Mexico is anti-bitcoin. Yes, you've heard of Salinas Pliego, the Mexican billionaire that has invested 10% of this liquid assets to bitcoin. Well, he tried to integrate bitcoin payments and bitcoin accounts into his bank, ""Banco Azteca"", and was quickly rebuffed by Mexico's banking authorities and the Central Bank, Banxico. Mexico's government's official position is that bitcoin is a ""speculative digital asset"" that has no place in the retail financial sector. 

And have you heard of Agust√≠n Carstens? Agustin Carstens is the current chair of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), so called the central bank of central banks. He's the counterpart to the IMF's Christine Lagarde, coordinating with the central banksters from around the world in case they ever need a global bailout from their fixing of the their national economies. He's also Mexican, formerly head of Banxico, and prior to that, head of Mexico's Finance Ministry. He set the policies that today put Mexico against bitcoin. 

On top of that, Mexico has a long history of infringing on FIFA rules against discrimination by having the crowd yell an homophobic chant. They have done this every match, and continue to accrue penalties. FIFA has threatened them with barring them from the World Cup if the behavior continues, and since Mexico are sore-losers, the behavior will continue if they continue to lose.

c) The match. Mexico is the obvious favorite to win. But we like underdogs here, right? El Salvador, against all odds, currently leads the group. Mexico needs a win to secure passage to the next round, but El Salvador qualifies with a tie. Mexico's stars Hirving 'El Chucky' Lozano and Raul Jimenez are injured, so El Salvador has a real chance here. The game is on Sunday night. Tune in!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: The Gold Cup is the equivalent to the EuroCup, but for North America, Central America, and the Caribbean. Usually, the finalists are USA and Mexico, and Mexico has won most often. The tournament is held in the USA. This Sunday, El Salvador play Mexico. The winner will lead their group and secure a qualification to the next round. El Salvador only needs a tie to achieve this. Mexico is the favorite, but we like underdogs. El Salvador is the pro-bitcoin team. Mexico is the anti-bitcoin team, that is also obnoxious and homophobic. So, I invite everyone here to support bitcoin by proxy of supporting El Salvador, and tune in on Sunday!",1626467980,PM_ME_YOUR_THESES,True,1,3,2021-07-17
Bitcoin,I got scammed‚Ä¶bad.,"So earlier today I was graced with a woman who would help me with getting into investing and ‚Äúflipping‚Äù my money Now that I am familiar with the terms, I now know that ‚Äúflipping‚Äù is a load of BS. So I started with $200 on cash app, buying 196.00 of bitcoin and then sent it to her. She then told me that I needed to ‚Äúsend her $500 for confirmation fee‚Äù and I told her I only had $458 left in my ENTIRE account total. She said she would be fine with it and she would help me so I get the best amount possible flipped. I sent it to her and she then stated it was ‚Äúupdated to 400‚Ä¶‚Äù so it was now at 4k being flipped and I stated I didn‚Äôt want that I just wanted to do the confirmation fee and get the 2500 back. She told me if I sent her 1k i would get my money. I told her no I don‚Äôt have that and she told me to ask friends for it. I said that‚Äôs BS and she said she would pay it off for me. Then she requested a validation of ID and SSN. I told her fuck that no. I called her out and told her to just revert it back to me and give it back, but she said basically ‚ÄúFuck you call the police idc‚Äù. I have contacted my bank and they said it was still pending on my card, and Cashapp has made a dispute claim. Is there ANY hope for me to get my money back? I know there is a blockchain, I don‚Äôt understand what any of that means. 

Now I get it: I messed up. and I have DRASTICALLY learned from this situation. 
Can someone provide some insight or at least tell me what I can do or if there‚Äôs any hope at all for me?

Bitcoin,When Bitcoin becomes the new Nr. 1 currency won't the rich end up having almost all of them ?,"Obligatory English isn't my first language, I am using Reddit mobile and I am new to Bitcoin.

As far as I understand there is an limited amount of Bitcoins, still a lot but it is limited. So my question is simple (I think).
The rich (like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates) have no possible way of spending all their Money, except donating huge amounts. They are, maybe unwillingly (if that makes sense), hording a lot of Bitcoins and not spend them therefore making them not accessible to the public. 
Won't the point come when the lower classes don't have access to Bitcoin anymore or a very limited amount? 

Let's say there are 100 Bitcoins.
50 Bitcoins are owned by states.
30 Bitcoins are owned by the richest 10%.
And the remaining 20 are owned by everyone else.
(Oversimplified but I hope that makes it clearer)

The Bitcoins owned by the state and the ""normal"" population is in circulation, getting payed in salaries, spend in stores, Taxes and so on. The richest 10% being, mostly, unable to spend their wealth will get more and more Bitcoins and therefore starve the state and the general public of their main currency. 

Will there be a point when we run out of Bitcoin because some people have most of them?

It could be a stupid question but it is on my mind for the past two hours and I need an answer. Thank you in advance.",1626461067,Lord_Keks,True,1,197,2021-07-17
Bitcoin,Apples Rumored $2.5 Billion Investment into BTC Might Trigger a Short Squeeze,"Bit Coin short positions have surpassed the records set in 2019. Over 13,600 bit coin shorts have been recorded while 51,000 long positions were observed on the derivatives exchange, Bitfinex. This leaves the market ripe for a short squeeze. 

With Apples rumored $2.5 billion purchase, the market could witness a short squeeze. 

The occurrence of short squeezes in the bit coin market is fairly common and in the event, a strong pump will leave short sellers in the mud leading to LIQUIDATION!

The short squeeze will trigger a price rally that will lead to the increase of Bit coin‚Äôs market capitalization which has been brought down to $611 billion. The common sentiment is that bit coin will continue to crash into the 20's pushing everyone away from entering the market or taking their money out but is this discount what the whales have been looking for?

Bitcoin,Sell Some Stocks to Buy Bitcoin?,"I'm 23 and have very few financial obligations (about 17K/year in total expenses). Pretax income is about 105K/year. I live in the Midwest US. I have a very long time horizon for my investments. This is my current asset allocation based on prices today:

&amp;#x200B;

[Total Allocation](https://preview.redd.it/acv024ckylb71.png?width=234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a98d6485590e70da48472b44c782477832ca160d)

My stocks are 100% VTSAX (with a VTSAX equivalent in my 401K). Crypto is 100% BTC. With my income, I could continue to invest about $500 / week for the remainder of the year based on my expenses and estimated 2021 tax liability while still maintaining my emergency fund.

**If you were in my shoes, would you:**

1. Hold all stocks and dollar cost average $500 / week into BTC for the remainder of the year
2. Sell some stocks in the taxable brokerage account (46k are long-term capital gains) to DCA more into BTC for the remainder of the year
3. Something else

If option 2, how much from the taxable brokerage account do you sell?

I realize everyone is different and situations vary a lot, but my risk tolerance is very high since I have a good career and minimal expenses. I can withstand the volatility of crypto no problem. I will continue to max out my 401K and Roth IRA in 2022 as well (already maxed out this year).

Bitcoin,The case for using bits and sats,"I know this sort of thing has been debated before and I'm glad that *sats* is becoming more recognised, especially with the growth of the lightning network, but I really think we could benefit from making **bits and sats** more widely used - particularly with wallets and merchants. Few reasons:

* Usual point about unit bias, but feels easier to grasp - *bits* already implies a smaller denomination of bitcoins, *sats* needs to be explained.
   * *""You don't have to buy a whole coin, you can buy 1000 bits""* vs.
   * *""You don't have to buy a whole coin, you can buy 100 000 sats""*
* Easier to explain in relation to major fiat currencies:
   * dollars / euros and cents
   * pounds and pence
* Easier to explain in relation to a bitcoin:
   * 100 sats in 1 bit
   * 1 million bits in 1 bitcoin
* Pricing for most items makes more sense than using bitcoin or sats. People are already familiar with using 2 decimal places in commerce. Some hypothetical examples:

||BTC|bits|sats|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Coffee|0.000095 BTC|95 bits|9500 sats|
|Big Mac|0.00016 BTC|160 bits|16000 sats|
|Computer|0.032 BTC|32000 bits|3200000 sats|
|Article Paywall|0.00000395 BTC|3.95 bits|395 sats|
|Podcast Stream|0.0000005 BTC / min|0.50 bits / min|50 sats / min|

&amp;#x200B;

* Future proof
   * Bitcoin at $32,000 \~ $1 = 32 bits
   * Bitcoin at $100,000 \~ $1 = 10 bits
   * Bitcoin at $1M \~ $1 = 1 bit

This also [doesn't change or introduce any new terms](https://bitcoin.org/en/vocabulary#bit), bitcoins and sats are just as valid and should be used if it's more appropriate, just think that in most cases bits / sats is more useful.

I also don't think it would add confusion. Americans are all familiar with a cent, a dollar and a grand. People in India and South Asia all know what paise, rupees and lakhs are. I think we can manage sats, bits and bitcoins.

Bitcoin,Contrarian view on CBDCs (single point),"It‚Äôs obvious that everyone is keeping a close eye on the ongoings, and trust me I am like everyone here wondering what‚Äôs going to happen. 

I do not have the authority to say how it will unfold, although I can speak to one specific aspect surrounding the concern of traceability. 

What I hear goes something like‚Ä¶ the gov will track every transaction and we will lose even more privacy

I‚Äôm not here to defend or discount CBDCs. No matter how illogical or logical, their existence is inevitable. So instead, I‚Äôm just outlining a single point. Whether cash is in physical or digital form, anonymity (frictionless flow) will be a component in the design. 

Take paper currency for example: by design not easy to track and follow. Go back further to gold coins: again, same thing. 

Free flowing cash is necessary for a free market to function properly. 

Breaking anonymity for some extra tax money would not add up to be enough to compensate for the friction it causes in the market. 

Surprisingly, in the late 90s an American economist predicted the need for a digital currency - all while clearly stating anonymity as a function.

Time and again, friction is left out. 

‚ÄúThe one thing that‚Äôs missing, but that will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B, without A knowing B or B knowing A
‚Ä¶The way I can take a $20 bill, hand it over to you, and then there‚Äôs no record of where it came from.

Bitcoin,A walkway collapses. 114 lose their lives. Bitcoin may have fixed this.," It may seem like a stretch but hear me out. Tomorrow marks 40 years since the collapse of the Hyatt Regency walkway in Kansas City, MO. The hotel was built in the 70s during the inflation crisis. 

The following excerpt from Wikipedia describes the environment at the time. Sound familiar? 

The Kansas City Star described a national climate of ""high unemployment, inflation and double-digit interest rates [which added] pressure on builders to win contracts and complete projects swiftly"". Described by the newspaper as fast-tracked, construction began in May 1978 on the 40-story Hyatt Regency Kansas City. There were numerous delays and setbacks, including the collapse of 2,700 square feet (250 m2) of the roof. The newspaper observed that ""Notable structures around the country were failing at an alarming rate"", which included the 1979 Kemper Arena roof collapse and the 1978 Hartford Civic Center roof collapse. The hotel officially opened on July 1, 1980.

Protecting your Eth from sudden price drops is a simple reality on Auctus.org. You can buy a put option that protects your downside risk. For example when Eth went up to $2300 a person bought a $2200 put and when Eth hit $1900 they were able to sell there eth for $2200. at that point you can buy it back at $1900.

You also have full control of your bitcoin with your keys.

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin adoption on a rise...Number of companies accepting bitcoin is on an upward trend. For anyone looking to get started, here is a list...","In the past years, bitcoin has seen tremendous growth in terms of adoption not just by people but by companies, investors, and even entire countries. 

A lot of businesses are realizing the power of this digital currency and the value it holds. 

There is really no better time to start accepting bitcoin payments on your webstore. The market is flooded with a number of payment gateway companies offering varying benefits to people.

One key distinction between various payment processors is based on how *decentralized* they are, a characteristic that is inherent in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Such processors usually have: 

* No identity verification ‚Äî KYC/AML
* Non-custodial payments (payments are *never* in custody of a third party) ‚Äî P2P \[Peer-2-Peer\]
* Slightly technical setup
* No fiat support

**Centralized** payment processors on the other hand offer a less technical setup but payments are usually held by third-party companies making them slightly risky. 

Here is the list of the top bitcoin payment processors:

1. GoURL: It is a 100% open-source cryptocurrency payment gateway offering a **WordPress** Plugin and an **API**. For custom-made websites, GoURL offers API for various programming languages including *PHP, JSON, C++, Java*, etc. 
2. Blockonomics: For BTC payments, it offers plugin integration for **WordPress**, **Prestashop, WHMCS, Wix, Squarespace,** and a **Payment API** for custom implementation.
3. BTCPay Server: A self-hosted, open-source cryptocurrency payment processor that offers plugin integration for **WordPress**, **Prestashop, Magento, Drupal, Custom Integration,** and **API.**
4. MyCryptoCheckout: A crypto payment plugin designed for **WordPress**. It's a Peer-2-Peer gateway that allows merchants to receive payment directly to their wallets.
5. CoinRemitter:  Crypto payment plugins for eCommerce merchants are available for **WordPress, Magento 2, Opencart, PrestaShop, Laravel, PHP,** and **REST APIs**. 
6. CoinPayments: They offer support for hundreds of cryptocurrencies and plugins for a variety of webstores making it one of the most comprehensive payment gateways in the market. 
7. Coingate:  Coingate provides support for multiple eCommerce CMS, including **WooCommerce, Prestashop, Magento, WHMCS, OpenCart**, and more, plus 100+ altcoin support. 
8. BitPay: They offer plugin support for almost every eCommerce CMS including, **WordPress, Prestashop, Shopify, WHMCS, EDD, Magento, Drupal**. 
9. Coinbase:  Offers support for **WooCommerce** and **Shopify** and charges no fee for crypto payments. 

*Blockonomics, MyCryptoCheckout, BTCPay, GoURL* are decentralized and do not require KYC. 

BitPay and Coinbase are infamous for their centralized model and have come under a lot of criticism for it but they still remain the top 2 payment companies by size and number.

Bitcoin,Deflationary debt spirals,"Naturally, it‚Äôs pretty exciting to have conversations about the many ways that Bitcoin is fundamentally changing and potentially improving the world. Whether it because it represents money for the people that is decentralized, secure and auditable, or the fact that it is provably digitally scarce and defined by a fixed currency supply making it the world‚Äôs most pure hard asset, or simply the innovations and technology being built onto its layered protocols, i‚Äôm inspired everyday by it as both a network protocol and an asset. 

And while I‚Äôd be among the first to explain to others the flaws with our current monetary system, the many ways in which inflation is a form of theft, the cantillon effect and quantitative easing etc., every now and then some part of me wonders deep down whether a world with a fixed and deflationary reserve currency represents a broadly better alternative (from an economic theory perspective) or whether it simply transitions us from one extreme to the other. 

The Bitcoin Standard fantasizes about the world during the gold standard and implies that a Bitcoin standard would be a permanent return to that, but I would push back and argue that there‚Äôs many more nuanced reasons as to why the gold standard failed from a business cycle and monetary perspective than simply arguing that it can only fail because of government greed and abuse. 

Ray Dalio has written plenty about the dangers of deflationary debt spirals and how they can destroy a society. I wonder if, while enriching those of us who already own it, a Bitcoin standard wouldn‚Äôt be terribly restrictive of global economic growth and progress as allocation of capital becomes much more limited.  For example, many of the great technologies we enjoy today (from Facebook to Google) may never have been created because ‚Äúloose monetary policy‚Äù and low interest rates is what made it economically feasible for them to be developed and exist despite not being profitable for some period of time. 

There‚Äôs many other examples of how a deflationary currency alters the dynamics behind the growth in loanable funds and investment and correspondingly GDP. Would love to hear whether others have shared the same thoughts and concerns, counter responses and alternative versions of reality, flaws in my thinking etc. 

TLDR: A fixed money supply greatly limits the allocation of capital which would hinder governments from funding many of the services we rely on and stall economic growth. BTC is good at taking back freedom  but very long term (decades or centuries) i wonder if it‚Äôs good for the economy",1626432651,somalley3,True,1,65,2021-07-16

[Caixin.com](https://Caixin.com) published an article ""China Says Goodbye to Bitcoin Mining"", which recorded the closure of a Bitcoin mine in Sichuan, China through several photographic pictures. Among them, a picture recorded a Tibetan woman carrying a mining machine. Since this picture recorded the historic moment when the Bitcoin mine in Sichuan, China was closed, and resembled the well-known oil painting \`\`Rice Gleaner,'' it quickly sparked heated discussions in the Bitcoin circle and was named ""Summer of Mining Machines"" Dora""

The picture was also uploaded to Opensea in the form of NFT after the second creation, and the price is roughly ranging from a few to a dozen ETH. The highest price is 2021 ETH. Some practitioners pointed out that Opensea is unable to solve the problem of such pirated artworks for the time being.

Bitcoin,Living in El Salvador for Bitcoin Libertarians," Hello everyone. 

I've been in bitcoin since 2013 and I'm accumulating all the time. I am a libertarian. I am raised in the works of Mises, Rothbard, and other members of the Austrian School of Economics. My question is as follows.

 Does it make sense at the moment to emigrate to El Salvador and invest your bitcoins in local infrastructure development? I am a network engineer and unix / linux administrator. I have always dreamed of having my own ISP company, preferably in combination with a cryptocurrency mine. 

I currently live in Europe and in relation to Agenda2030 it is very difficult for a person with views of freedom to live here. Not economically but I feel that this is no longer my place on earth. 

Is El Salvador a good place to live for a person like me? What do i need: 

\- Little bureaucracy

 \- Low taxes

 \- Relatively good health care 

\- Safety for living and running a business. 

I am asking especially about security for a foreigner, because on the Internet you can read that El Salvador is one of the least safe countries in the world and I would like to verify it somehow.

Bitcoin,Renewable sources,"For some miners, the decision to move out of China is also an opportunity to clean up their power supply. 

It‚Äôs difficult to say how dirty Bitcoin mining is overall, but it‚Äôs a reflection of the power supply to a mine‚Äôs location. Earlier this year, tens of thousands of mining machines consumed about 45 million kilowatt-hours of power per month in an area of western China that depends on coal-burning power plants, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. That‚Äôs about 15,000 tons of standard coal. Overall, mining machines globally consume about as much power as all of Bangladesh, a country of more than 160 million people.

While some of that power is green, the majority of the world‚Äôs electricity still comes from burning fossil fuels.

For example, I have a group of women over 50 with second homes and they swap homes instead of paying for accommodations when they travel. Currently, groups like this pay $150 per swap to my company.

I'm thinking of forming a bitcoin home swapping group. Typically, individuals are grouped together based on similar lifestyles for equitable swapping. We meet all members before we group them. I do realize that bitcoin, in it's own right, isn't a lifestyle choice that would assume equitable exchanges of homes, but I am wondering if it's a bonding enough element to form a group. And yes, members of this group would make home swaps in bitcoin instead of dollars.

So the only way CBDCs would have any use or efficiency gains over a visa card is if they all live on either ethereum as erc20 tokens or they are all interoperable with the lightning network and lightning invoices.

Heres the thing, in either scenario that would mean lightning bitcoin or wrapped btc would be able to be sent to any wallet that uses CBDCs and spent anywhere that accepts CBDCs.

CBDCs will massively boost the use and functionality of bitcoin itself. It might take time for the masses to abandon central bank monetary policy and adopt bitcoin monetary policy but being able to spend bitcoin anywhere in the meantime would be huge.",1626395072,slvbtc,True,1,3,2021-07-16

Bitcoin,United States citizens can no longer short Bitcoin or participate in leveraged digital asset transactions unless they're filthy rich!,"On June 23, 2021, the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) went into effect in the United States. The CEA set new guidelines for retail investors (people like you and me) to trade crypto with margin. For individuals or retail investors, to be eligible to trade crypto with margin, you must be certified as an Eligible Contract Participant (ECP). A retail investor must have $10 million in assets to be certified as an ECP. 

You can view the requirements here.

Additionally, you can view Kraken's new blog about leveraged digital asset transactions here. 

[https://blog.kraken.com/post/9514/new-requirements-for-u-s-and-starter-tier-clients-to-qualify-for-margin-trading/](https://blog.kraken.com/post/9514/new-requirements-for-u-s-and-starter-tier-clients-to-qualify-for-margin-trading/)

So what does this mean for regular US citizens like you and me? For starters, it means that US citizens can no longer short sell bitcoin. You might ask, ""Can't we just short bitcoin without leverage?"" well no, you can't! It is impossible to short any assets without leverage since the nature of shorting involves borrowing a security, then selling it on the open market. We are once again being suppressed by the government. The US government saw that normal people were getting rich, bringing themselves out of poverty, and they decided to stop it. I have been leverage trading bitcoin for about 5 years now and I have made a good life for myself. I was able to pay off my student loans and pay off my car leveraging bitcoin in my spare time and I have always paid Uncle Sam my fair share of taxes when I profit. 

Look, I am all for government regulation in crypto. I think that in order for Bitcoin to get mainstream adoption, there needs to be more government regulation. However, with this new definition of an ECP the US government is only looking after corporate America and all of their wealthy friends, not its citizens. So now if I want to short bitcoin or trade with leverage, I have to renounce my citizenship and move to another country. And obviously, I know that I can use a VPN, but the prison system in America is one of the worst in the world, and it's not worth the risk if you ask me.

&amp;#x200B;

.... I think it is kind of funny that the US government is always saying that Bitcoin is only used by criminals and for money laundering. Well now by leverage trading any digital asset you are now considered a criminal... unless you are filthy rich, then you're fine.",1626392347,No_Examination_2681,True,1,179,2021-07-16

""The account blockings makes sense especially regarding preventing sensorship if a government wanted to take control over the money of their citizens. As for inflation, Cryptos lose their value...go up and down. Bitcoin dropped by 50%...so if someone had put in 100K in bitcoin, their funds would have lost 50% of its value where's inflation does not do that, irrespective of the possibility that bitcoin ""might"" go up.

Typically sanctions and embargoes are against nations which prevent trade and so on; so El Salvador for example has made Bitcoin their legal tender, how exactly would that benefit them if for example They were sanctioned and embargoed?

CBDC's would be pegged to their respective currencies along with whatever other features that they give them using the blockchain technology and unlike regular paper money they would not have technological advantages that Cryptos have making them more than just ""regular fiat"", No?""

Bitcoin,Considering using Lightning Network; New Questions,"**TLDR**

Long time buyer, holder, and user of Bitcoin (since 2015). Absolutely zero experience with Lightning Network. I've read some entry-level tutorials but still have basic conceptual questions regarding funding, capacity, revocations, etc.

**Hypothetical Situation**

Let's say I run a gambling site. All business is conducted in BTC. More and more customers are asking that Lightning Network be made available to facilitate quick and cheap deposit and withdrawal of funds.

**Where do I connect for maximum reach?**

The tutorials always seem show to show two parties, Bob and Alice. They open a ""channel"" using a funding transaction. The example then typically adds in a third party (e.g. Festus) and says something along the lines of ""and look, Bob can pay Festus through Alice."" 

The implication seems to be that the network size could become enormous, to the point where anyone can pay anyone because hey, every Bitcoin user is inevitably connected by only a few degrees of separation on the network.

But this doesn't really answer the question of to whom I, as a brand new user, should connect? I could connect to you, I guess. But maybe you're a new user too and have zero other connections. Do I connect to some sort of hub? Guess that would work but doesn't that make things overly centralized?

As a site owner (see hypothetical above), is it best for me to act as a hub and open a channel with each of my users, which means I'd have thousands of channels open? Or is it better to make a single connection to one really popular, well-connected dude? Seems like the latter, but which dude? How do I find him?

**Do I always have to be online looking for cheats?**

Ok, so I get that my LN peer can try to cheat me by broadcasting a settlement transaction of a prior balance state that's more advantageous to him. And I also know that his cheat TX settlement won't clear for twenty-four hours, giving me time to broadcast a ""revocation"" TX that settles everything in my favor instead. This is what dissuades my peer from cheating.

But this also implies that my Lightning node needs to be up 24/7, or at least never offline for more than 24 hours and, furthermore, I have to be ever vigilant to make sure no one is cheating, and execute revocations if they are. Are these assumptions correct? Does the Lightning software automate the cheat-detection process for me?

**How do I Add Funds to an existing channel?**

It's still not clear how to add funds to a preexisting channel. I've seen some material online indicating that a third party service needs to be paid for this? I can't imagine that's correct is it? That doesn't seem compatible with the whole ethos of LN.

Using my hypothetical example. Let's say a client opens a channel with me and sends me 1 BTC. He bets on an upcoming UFC fight (Ronda Rousey vs. Oprah Winfrey). A successful bet on Winfrey pays 15x. That means in the unlikely even that he wins, I need to have at least 15 BTC available *on that channel* to pay him out.

How do I add funds to the channel if he wins? Or does that 15 BTC have to be placed in the channel via the initial funding transaction?

Now, if I'm servicing all users over a single channel, that's fine. But if each user has his own channel, I'd have to fund each one with an enormous amount of BTC -- despite the fact that 99.99% of my users will never even bet on that particular event at all. That would be an inefficient use of funds. I assume there's a way to add funds to a channel after initial funding, but how?

**Wallet Recommendations**

I'm running on Win 2019 Server and need to be able to create channels, send funds, be notified of incoming funds, etc. using an API. Which wallet should I use for this?

With Bitcoin's first layer, I have the option of either running a full blown node or leveraging a centralized service like Electrum? Does LN have an analogous situation with two different styles of wallet?",1626383198,tradecheap,True,1,8,2021-07-16

2. Send all the funds through to a no-KYC lightning wallet like Muun

3. Use Muun to send that balance back on-chain to a bc1 address

4. Close channel and never combine the change from the channel close with the btc sent on-chain using muun.

Since transaction fees are very low at the moment this almost seems better than a coinjoin because you can see on-chain if coin has recently been through a coinjoin.",1626382681,needmoretime82,True,1,3,2021-07-16

Bearish targets are 24k, 20k and if that doesn‚Äôt hold 15k. I‚Äôm a buyer at all 3 levels, weights will depend on factors if and when that happens. The major resistances are 39k and of course 59k. Despite slightly trending downwards, volatility has sharply fallen off a cliff, take a look below at Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility index. I suspect an increase in volatility will arrive soon from this extended period of consolidation. I‚Äôll go into more of the direction and how I plan to trade it next

&amp;#x200B;

**What trades am I making for Bitcoin?**

Short calls to generate yield is the main strategy. The occasional long put protection or long put spread will be put on during expected volatility (like right now). Additionally, I just started adding size to my August short 50k call position over the last 3 days. I think I will add a little more to it but not much more.   
**Quick Math:** 2 BTC @ 33k each is 66k. Target yield for August is 10k+ USD which is about 17% rounded (10k/66k). I have considerably less BTC on exchanges now and I am also transitioning to a much less management intensive trading style as it is Summer and I haven‚Äôt been outside in ages.

Bitcoin,"If whales are buying BTC, why isnt the price going up?","Hello,

Just a thought.

To my understanding, Crypto is the people's money. Its value is that we as a community find it valuable. The more $$$ we put in it, the higher it goes.

The past year, we saw BTC price soar through the roof because everyone and their friends were investing $$$ into it. And then we saw a HUGE crash because everyone started selling it due to panic of FUD, Elon, etc.

Recently (2-4 months), I've been reading that a lot of institutional investors and ""whales"" are buying a HUGE amount of BTC at the $35K-$40K range. If this is the case, why haven't seen the price go up and why is it still leveled at the $35K-$40K range?

If billions of dollars are being invested into BTC by these commercial investors and whales, wouldn't that drive the price up?

I hope this makes sense.",1626366060,jamezshark,True,1,28,2021-07-16

Bitcoin,Instant Gratification vs Long Term Potential,"Hey internet srangers, what would you do in my situation?

I'm not doing great lately; at work steady growing burnout state, I'm completely mentally drained now and can't even focus on and acomplish basic tasks. Went from being the best employee to the worst employee in 3 years. Need to fix this as I'm at a point that I question my job security.

So I took all my vacation days and got 4 weeks off approved. Great! 

But I can't stay home during 4 weeks, as I've been working from home for the last year and need a change of scenary to reset my brain.

Thus I had decided to buy an RV and travel for a month, maybe even work remotely from the RV afterwards until Fall, thinking that this will solve my burnout. 

Found a nice RV, settled on a price, called my bank, and they refused the loan because my expense ratios are too high. I'm spending over 1000$/mo on electricity for mining so because of that I can't qualify for a high amount loan, which is frustrating as loans are dirt cheap now. I can't also just shutdown the miners for a week and reapply as they want to see a few months of consistent low electricity bills.

So now the question is; do I sell half of my crypto stack to buy the RV? We're at a sideways market now and about half of what the top was recently so it feels like it's a bad time to sell anything.

I've convinced myself that I need the RV to travel and properly reset my brain to be able to re-become effective at my day job. If I lose that job, I lose the ability to have the cashflow to pay for my mortgage and electricity bill to continue mining. Can't let that happen.

But if I sell half of my stash to buy the RV today, I'm sure that in a few years that chunk would of bought me 2 RVs, a boat and a house, and that I'd regret having sold :) 

And that's my dilemma. Do I jeopardize potential future crypto gains in exchange of gratification today? Or I keep holding and because of that don't fully take advantage of my 4 weeks off and potentially lose my job because I didn't fix my burnout by the time I need to go back to work in a month.

Feels like I'm stuck here.

The obvious answer would be to do something else for 4 weeks but I don't see anything else that could occupy me outside my house for that period.",1626365900,W944,True,1,6,2021-07-16

Bitcoin,"I live off of Bitcoin, and I still don't understand how it works","Hello, I'm not used to this site so forgive if I get something wrong. But I did read the rules.  
I'm not an ""internet guy"", my son showed me Reddit some time ago. I didn't give much attention to it, it's not my kind of thing. Today I opened it again and found out there is a community here about Bitcoin.  


My story is that I ""bought"" it when it was cheap in 2013. I was selling my car to a friend of mine, he didn't have all the money to buy it, just a part of it. He asked me to split the amount in installments. I declined, I don't like installments. Then he asked if he could pay for the rest of the value with his Bitcoins.  


He explained for a long time what it was, and why it worked like money. At first, I didn't like the idea. But I wasn't needing all the money at that time, and he said he could buy it back. So we did it.  


He teached me to use it though I didn't really used it for a long time. It was just sitting there. Of course I heard the news that it was getting value. This same friend told me to buy a physical wallet to hold it. He said it was more safe, and I agree. I also like to have something that is not just in my computer.  


In the last years, I retired earlier. Every month I sell some of my Bitcoins to this same friend. Not any insane amount, just what I need for my family expenses etc. And sometimes some more when I need to buy something new.  


I don't live a live of luxuries. I have a good house, a good car. I pay for my children college and school and we do some family travels together. And I guaranteed they have a house to live. That's enough for me  


That's it, I'm not in any Bitcoin related community or discussion. I don't know how it works. My friend tried to explain me a lot of times. I know enough about it to use all these years. I know how to send, how to receive and I have my pass phrase in a paper well hidden.  


I read about how you guys buy and sell it all the time. I'm not any specialist and I might be wrong. But maybe you just need a little more patience. It took a long time for my Bitcoins to be worth something.  


Excuse me if I don't reply you. As I said, I don't really use Reddit

Bitcoin,Litecoin is friend not food," As  we all know Litecoin was disappointing in this bull run so far. It  barely reached, or depending on who you ask because we apparently have  two ATHs lol, didn't reach it. Despite this, Litecoin is still our  favorite little Chikun to hate or love. Here are my reason to love it  starting with the newest information.

# FRIENDS NOT ENEMIES:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i2dur1ku0eb71.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06c0140abca0bceff4269a8044052b2071f89c89

Litecoin  has constantly been marketed as the Silver to Bitcoin's gold. I know a  lot of people hate this marketing, but it's what has stuck around and  will continue to stick around. Litecoin has continued to bea oscillator  of grandpa bitcoin, and their futures will follow the same path.  Litecoin has consistently been disrespected by BTC hodlers for being a  clone of bitcoin. The faster transactions, lower fees, and increased  coin supply isn't what makes litecoin better, it's what makes bitcoin  better. Let me explain. Bitcoin is obviously the og of every crypto  project out there. It's the grandpa of the family, the old man that  commands respect and will be the first one to say his opinion on  something. Litecoin is grandpa's annoying son who helps him pay his  bills online. What I mean here is, Bitcoin's fees and slow transactions  are not a discredit to the project, but a change of use case. The people  looking to spend Bitcoin would be better off making big payment amounts  like buying houses, boats, lambos, and jets. While litecoin is better  suited to SUPPORTING bitcoin hodlers with purchases like bubblegum,  condoms, and meals with your sister's best friend. We are a team guys.  We are the early adopters. If bitcoin succeeds, we all succeed.

# NEW ACTIVITY:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9mfcqf8v0eb71.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65fb12051a45f2747ccdee183a6c43324245d27f

The  fact that we have 4x the amount of ACTIVE addresses than we did 7  months ago, is astounding. 340,000 a day. Does this truly sound like a  dead coin to you? Do this truly show no use case? I'll let you decide.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n3yzgzhw0eb71.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2361504d2c532ed4bc2829f6441ede1f39d1407d

# PUBLICITY:

Litecoin  continuously makes appearances in places you would never expect. From  Nascar drivers to MMA fighters, litecoin is putting it's name out there.  I'll be the first one to acknowledge that Litecoin doesn't have the  apex predator of marketing teams out there, but it's impressive that  after 10 years of existence, we haven't failed like the thousands of  projects that have.

# GRAYSCALE:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eyifacoy0eb71.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a864e3610b48a20397d64e09ee8d1251b32d1045

If  you've been in the Litecoin Markets sub for more than 1 day, you'll  know this is the most hopium concentrated news that we expect will show a  big bang. Grayscale has continuously loaded up on LTC this whole time.  They bought LTC during it's $400 run, they bought LTC before and after  the spike. Money this big can afford to be wrong in some areas, but not  THIS wrong. I expect big things will happen in the future with  Litecoin's price, and the people that disrespect the Chikun might be a  little salty.

# The Fundamentals:

* Fast Transactions
* Low Fees
* Available on every platform that BTC is on, even paypal.
* Institutions love boring, but working financial projects.
* Mweb, an optional privacy feature coming soon.

# THE FUD:

And  finally to address the titan level fud that will never escape litecoin  until everyone in this generation dies, yes Charlie Lee sold fairly  mined litecoin. Whatever his motive was for doing so, whether you think  he is evil incarnate and scammed everyone or truly wanted to have  decentralized currency, it's up to you. But what we don't see is the  same fud being applied to other projects. Ethereum creator,  Vitalik and  ""managers"" premined over 70 million ethereum and sold becoming a  billionaire. How this isn't worse than selling your fairly mined coins  and tweeting that you were going to, is beyond me. That is not to say  Vitalik was wrong for doing anything! I would be Charlie Lee and Vitalik  in a heartbeat. But despite the reputation stain that hasn't left him,  Charlie has been working on Litecoin ever since. He has never left the  project, and is the main reason Litecoin is accepted on every platform  Bitcoin is. It's apart of the OG listings, and will be the only coin  with paypal that has privacy features.  I think Charlie has more or less  paid for his sins, and the fud will not change Litecoin's fundamentals  in 10 years.

Conclusion:

Bitcoin  and Litecoin are my biggest holdings in Crypto. I love the communities  surrounding them with every fiber of my being. We are the early  adopters. We are future Lamborghini holders.

When the pandemic first hit I had lost my job. My emergency fund was thinning out and bitcoin was all I had left. I had about 2 days left to come up with funds to pay bills. I came really close to selling. I had my hardware wallet plugged in, typed my exchange address, placed a test amount and pressed send. Then my hardware wallet notified I had an invalid address, I made a typo. I paused and though, am I really going to sell, is this it? No Lambo? No citadel? No trip to the moon? No this can't be it. I decided I would take any job, no matter what it was, be a online typewriter, be a virtual assistant, take on low interest debt, anything to stall me from  selling. In the end I didn't sell. Today, despite bitcoin being ""low"" it is still my best performing asset. Today, I have even made buffers to prevent me from panic selling. I bought 2 safes, i placed my keys in 1 safe and placed that safe in the other safe, so a hardware wallet in a safe in safe. I also placed a sticky note in each of the them saying ""are you absolutely sure, you have tried everything"" as to give me enough time to think it over and mental reminder if I'm ever in panic mode.

Bitcoin,Analysis - Similarities to Oct '18 - Jan '19,"Hi all,  


Just thought I'd share something interesting I've found when looking at the weekly chart of Bitcoin with 9 period bollinger bands - at a glance I could hardly distinguish between the below two time periods.  


Note: I am relatively new to technical analysis and this in no way constitutes any form of advice. Just happy to share my curious findings with you all.

 

**BTC/USD - 15th of October 2018 to 14th January 2019**

* Weekly chart, 9 period Bollinger Bands
* Local high preceding volatility squeeze = $6700
* 54% correction, 2 large red candles after 1st squeeze
* Huge volume spike on second red candle
* Formed a multi-year bottom (never reached again) of $3100
* Time from local high to the weekly candle within second squeeze = 91 days

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**BTC/USD - 12 April 2021 to 12 July 2021**

* Weekly chart
* 9 period Bollinger Bands
* Local high preceding volatility squeeze = $64,800
* 55% correction, 2 large red candles after 1st squeeze
* Huge volume spike on second red candle
* Local low formed of $28,500, is this a multi-year bottom?
* Time from local high to the weekly candle within second squeeze = 91 days

It is very interesting to see the similarities in these two moments in time, even down to the dollar figures involved (you could multiply the 2018-19 prices by 10 and get almost the exact scenario we have today).

This could point to our recent low being the equivalent of a bear market low as experienced in the 2018-19 scenario. In the earlier scenario, a big run to the upside followed to $13,800 approximately 5.5 months later, eerily similar (by a multiple of 10) to the \~$140k price prediction of Celsius' Alex Machinsky by the end of this year.

The most notable difference between the two scenarios are that the volume was much higher in the 2018-19 scenario compared to now, but its unclear to me what impact this would have.

Whatever the case, most likely this year ***does not*** play out exactly like 2019 did, but it is still interesting to see a plausible picture of the next 6 months or so for Bitcoin.",1626336022,BeGoodie,True,1,0,2021-07-15

Bitcoin,Poolin Wallet Introduction," 

Wallets are divided into onchain wallets and offchain wallets.

Onchain wallet transactions can be checked on blockchain. The user keeps his own private key to support mnemonics, import private keys and other functions.

Offchain wallets are centralized wallets, generally provided by exchanges. The transaction is essentially an adjustment of the amount of the internal account of the exchange. The user does not need to keep private key, but only needs to remember the account of wallet. This mode is simple to operate, and can realize real-time payment.

Poolin Wallet is an offchain wallet with high efficiency. Poolin Wallet is a centralized digital asset management wallet that integrates storage, transaction, lending, asset management, and DeFi production by Mixin team with technical support.¬†

* One-stop service. Poolin mining pool and Poolin Wallet are connected, and Poolin mining pool account can be used directly to log in to Poolin Wallet, safe and convenient.
* No threshold limit. Mining in Poolin mining pool and using Poolin Wallet to receive money is not subject to threshold limit.
* Diversification of financial products bring you stable income, and it's safe and reliable.

Please contact us if you have further questions.

Bitcoin,Why Stablecoins are Doomed to Fail and Michael Saylor is WRONG about BTC not becoming a transactional currency.,"You may have heard Michael Saylor (and many altcoiners) talk recently about how Bitcoin is stuck as digital gold, because it's not a good transactional currency. Saylor even went so far to say in [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1Gu7Ym-Quo&amp;lc=z23uyjcgyzqdxptdbacdp43bmhr2al5dqctrtce4bipw03c010c) a day or two back that Stablecoins, specifically, will fill that niche.  

Anyone who was around in the early days of bitcoin or has read cyphperpunk history can easily tell you what the government used to do to anyone or any company that tried to compete with the dollar. Stablecoins are run by centralized parties like companies and governments are never going to let them compete with their money when they can just tell the centralized party to stop. US congressmen went nuts a year or two back when Facebook announced Libra, and held a grand congressional inquiry just on the plans, stopping his original approach. They'll continue to stop future approaches too as long as he tries to make a coin that competes with the dollar in any way.

But even if you think there is some loophole, there's another, more important reason why bitcoin will in fact destroy any other coin, stable or not, that tries to be a medium of exchange.

In short, the best money that everyone desires is the hardest money. The hardest money is the one with the best store of value features. Gold proved this for millennia. Saylor fails to remember that gold was the most used medium of exchange for most of the last 5000 years! 

When your hard property takes on the  characteristics of a currency, (being portable, scarce, fungible, easily  identified, hard to counterfeit, durable, etc) then it's called ""Hard""  money. That's a good thing. It's the money that you hold onto more than  other money, but it's still the most desirable money.  

Goldbugs and Austrian economics have long sang the praises of hard money. Separating hard money from transactional money has only been done because of government decree. (Fiat) Transactional money on it's own simply cannot compete with hard money on an open marketplace. 

Stablecoins will never be able to compete with bitcoin because they aren't desirable to hold on to. People will never trust them to store value over time, so why hold them at all? Why BOTHER to hold two types of money when you trust one and not the other? It's an unneeded hassle.

I give this stablecoin fad another 4-8 years tops. After that, all you can depend on in this world is your bitcoin, and the lightning network will be more than capable by then to make it more useful as a transactional currency than any other money on earth. 

Now the question is: Is Saylor wrong on purpose to avoid some kind of government backlash against bitcoin?",1626327242,maxcoiner,True,1,51,2021-07-15

Bitcoin,BTC mining will still be less difficult but analysts say the bull market has not yet reached its peak,"July 14, Hefei online published an article ""I comprehensively clean up and shut down the virtual currency mining project"" pointed out that in the next three years, the province's electricity supply and demand situation is grim, Anhui will fully clean up and shut down the virtual currency mining project. ¬†Prior to this, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Yunnan and Sichuan have also issued relevant policies to promote the liquidation of crypto-mining projects. ¬†As the policy came out, the Bitcoin hashing rate dropped. ¬†

However, the latest data showed an average bitcoin processing power of 96.6 eH /s, slightly higher than the previous 90.5 eH /s. ¬†At the next reset, the difficulty of mining could be reduced by 11.08%, the data estimated, a slight downward trend from the last drop of more than 20%. ¬†

Analysts say that as the gradual completion of the evictions and a steady migration of remaining miners have leveled off the Bitcoin network, computing power has leveled off and the difficulty has eased. ¬†

In addition, half of the world's computing power will eventually leave China and need new ""homes,"" said Castleisland Ventures founding partner NicCarter. ""Chinese miners or those registered in China are looking to Central Asia, Eastern Europe, the United States and Northern Europe."" ¬†

According to public data, the first batch of virtual currency mining machines arrived in Kazakhstan on June 21. 320 mining machines are estimated to be 18.2PH/S, and are expected to be deployed and put into operation on June 27. Other mining machines are also being shipped overseas in batches. ¬†A handful of virtual currency mines are already in Kazakhstan, Texas, Canada, Europe and elsewhere. ¬†

To date, Iranian authorities have authorized 30 cryptocurrency mines to conduct digital currency mining. ¬†The cryptocurrency mines are spread across several regions, including one in Tehran province, which is home to the national capital. ¬†Semnan province is reported to have the most licensed mines with six, followed by Alborz province with four, Mazandaran, Eastern Azerbaijan and Zanjan. ¬†

U. S. utility Talen Energy is building a nuclear crypto mine and data center near its Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, with a capacity of 164 megawatts in the first phase and 300 megawatts when completed. ¬†Talen Energy founded Cumulus Data in 2020 to ""invest in opportunities to merge digital infrastructure with power."" ¬†Cumulus has two separate businesses, Cumulus Data, which focuses on ultra-large-scale computing centers, and Cumulus Coin, which focuses on digital currency mining. ¬†

In addition, US-based cryptocurrency consultancy and mining company Wattum has signed an agreement to acquire a crypto mine operated by Energix in Kazakhstan. ¬†The two companies will build a mining facility to provide 16 megawatts of energy for mining machines and have committed to invest $2 million in the joint venture. ¬†Wattum and Energix are also negotiating for another 50-megawatt mine at a cost of $8 million ¬†

It is worth noting that the migration of miners has been accompanied by a growing search for clean energy. ¬†Bitmain has been holding information sessions for customers looking for clean power. ¬†The US House of Representatives has also recently passed legislation requiring public companies to disclose environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators. ¬†The bill passed by a vote of 215 to 214 and now goes to the Senate for consideration. ¬†The bill also requires the SEC to establish a ""sustainable finance advisory board"". ¬†The bill's passage could help shift bitcoin miners to clean energy. ¬†

In addition, billionaire Chrissacca said he owns many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, and believes their environmental costs will drive the development of clean energy solutions. ¬†

With the migration of miners and the search for clean energy. ¬†Many analysts believe the bull market is not over yet. ¬†Analyst Willywoo recently tweeted that the estimated number of users on the Bitcoin chain is growing faster than at any time in its 12-year history, even at this stage. ¬†

In his latest video predicting when the Bitcoin bull market will end, crypto analyst NicholasMerten points out that we're seeing cycle extensions of 11 to 13 months per cycle.  So if we follow history, we can add 12 months here.  Forty-seven months is the expected length of the cycle we're in right now...

Bitcoin,How to sign a psbt transaction with software wallets? [Electrum &amp; Others],"**So I've been looking for days to sign a PSBT transaction but upon to all my research i failed or i just haven't searched in the right place.**

&amp;#x200B;

**The PSBT content is generated from a payment gateway that I've been using for my web services  named** [btcpaymerchant.com](https://btcpaymerchant.com) **and it provides me a version of the PSBT encoded and decoded with inputs/outputs/txid/pubkey/etc..**

&amp;#x200B;

**I only need to sign it and** **~~broadcast~~** \*\*it from what i understood I've tried importing the file to electrum but it doesn't let me to sign it/\*\***~~broadcast~~** **ibt.**

# ‚Ä¢What i tried:

* Tried directly importing the **PSBT** content to electrum and saving it to transaction history and proceeding to sign it but **electrum** disables the buttons to sign/~~broadcast~~ automatically when opening the transaction.
* Steps i took on **electrum** to import the **PSBT** to wallet are:

*Tools -&gt; Load Transaction -&gt; From File/From Text -&gt; Save*

\*Then the transaction appears as local \[rbf\] without allowing me to sign it/\**~~broadcast~~* *it,*

*image:* [*https://imgur.com/a/AGrhjo9*](https://imgur.com/a/AGrhjo9)

&amp;#x200B;

* Tried using [coinb.in](https://coinb.in) to sign/verify/~~broadcast~~ the transaction no success and it resulted in an error when attempting to ~~broadcast~~.

***Error:*** *\[scriptsig-not-pushonly (code 64)  error\] when trying to* *~~broadcast~~*

* Different wallets and wallets type from bip32-&gt;44-&gt;49.
* When trying to import [https://coinb.ib](https://coinb.ib) encoded transaction to **electrum** it results in the same error \`scriptsig-not-pushonly\` **\[image of the error:**  [https://imgur.com/bnx5LZV](https://imgur.com/bnx5LZV) **\]**
* I also tried researching the shit out of this and how to do it for 2 days.

**‚Ä¢Most of you may ask why didn't i contacted support?**

*That's a good point i tried but they haven't responded, i read the documentation several times but still no success \[*[*https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Wallet/*](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Wallet/)*\].*

&amp;#x200B;

**They offer the following steps for PSBT transactions.**

* *A PSBT gets constructed with certain inputs and outputs, but no signatures*
* *The exported PSBT can be imported by a wallet that supports this format*
* *The transaction data can be inspected and signed using the wallet*
* *The signed PSBT file gets exported from the wallet and imported with BTCPay Server*
* *BTCPay Server produces the final Bitcoin transaction*
* *You verify the result and broadcast it to the network*

**Most of the people use hardware wallets to sign these transactions but currently i do not own one if you have any other suggestions of software wallets that could help me out im all ears.**

**Thanks for your attention and helping!**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT \[reason: more specific questions\]:**

**What exactly needs to be signed?**

* The whole transaction?
* The inputs or outputs?
* Or anything?

&amp;#x200B;

**How do you combine the signature  with the message/transaction?**

* I know there is a setting ""merge signatures from"" while viewing the transaction but for me it results in a parsing error :

***Electrum was unable to parse your transaction: ValueError('failed to recognize transaction encoding for txt:...)***

***I noticed during my testings/research there is a json value in the decoded transaction called*** `partial_signatures`

that is formatted like this: `""partial_signatures"": {},`

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Asked about the Fed's plans for a digital dollar, Powell replied: ‚ÄúAs we are the international reserve currency, we believe we need to get this right and we don't feel the need to go first. In fact, we already have the pioneering advantage because we have the world's reserve currency. ‚Äù  
... On the rise of stablecoins (stable cryptocurrencies), Powell stated that ""There is clearly a demand \[for currencies\] and we have been very focused on providing better regulatory responses to potential global stablecoins."" According to Powell, studying stablecoins is a top priority for the Fed, as ""they can become systemically important overnight.""

&amp;#x200B;

Now get back here.

Have you ever stopped to imagine this: most countries in the world have their international reserves in dollars - Brazil, for example, has $356 billions - news in March 2021). Thus, it is not possible to deny that this is a fiat currency that move the world and business as a whole.

A series of concerns thinking here:

1- How is it that the ""health"" of cryptocurrencies can be maintained in the long term with the main ""threat"" being the ""centralization"" of central banks and their fiat currencies? Or the Opposite: How can central banks enter the decentralized world of cryptos in a way that does not undo all the power and underwritten capacity of their fiat currencies? It's a knot in the brain üòÜ.

2 - Here comes a number of other things in my mind: bitcoins, for example, are finite... which would prevent a person from just concentrating all this power for themselves in a physical wallet (imagine the hardware with all the Bitcoins already created in the world ü§£. This is a Rich guy!!!), or within digital central banks in your countries?

I go even further: would it be possible to still have a universal crypto currency of free circulation that has the same power as the dollar has today?",1626292439,kriskastro,True,1,12,2021-07-15

Bitcoin,Orignal post by u/xcryptoguru - EXPOSED: Tesla lost its carbon credits market in Europe so it's trying to create a renewable credits market by attacking Bitcoin mining,"
I'm going to try to explain Elon Musk's seemingly ""big brain"" but actually pretty dumb gambit with regards to Bitcoin mining. Note carefully the dates on each development in the story.

Why did Tesla buy $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin?

Couple of factors - one short-term and one long-term.

**Short-term play** \- Tesla's production was halted due to supply chain effects from the pandemic. This is why there has been a lot of delivery delays this year. This meant that Tesla's shrinking profits from selling carbon credits to other carmakers alone wasn't enough to post a profitable quarter. So Tesla decided to buy Bitcoin and then sell some of it before the end of the quarter to make up for the shortfall.

[Bitcoin purchase ensured profitable Q1 2021 for Tesla](https://preview.redd.it/2cbuwb9xt4b71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f26f8d68c1e3d87def0783972627696905d5368)

**Long-term play** \- The reason for Tesla's revenue from carbon credits sales shrinking is that European carmakers are shifting focus to EV themselves, meaning they no longer need to purchase credits from Tesla to comply with strict emissions regulations in the EU.

[2020 was Tesla's first-ever net-positive year thanks to soaring carbon credits sales](https://preview.redd.it/4xyofb47u4b71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=821d0344237233cc0322cf0daa03bb0c0282e66f)

[But that source of revenue is now shrinking \(May 6\)](https://preview.redd.it/cqcxl5kbu4b71.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4121b24c5321d3530eb4e306d0da98193446a3f)

So Tesla now needs to make up for this potentially permanent revenue loss. What do they do?

**One day before Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin payments due to** ***""rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions""*****, Tesla applied for renewable credits certificate from the EPA.**

[Tesla applied for renewable credits one day before Bitcoin mining FUD \(May 12\)](https://preview.redd.it/bxtcrpigu4b71.png?width=1025&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3a8106383a5b92051bde86f2136fdcc5f2932ab)

Unlike carbon credits, the EPA's renewable credits can be sold in the open market to ANY industry. Elon figured he could create a new renewable credits market out of Bitcoin mining.

Too bad for Elon Bitcoin mining uses 4x higher than the average share of renewables in the US (56%)

The dumbest part of all this has to be the use of ""and transactions"" because no incremental energy is used for transactions. This guy frankly has zero understanding of how Bitcoin works.

Personally, I don't think he cares to understand. Notice how he's trying to hijack dog coin and turn it into PayPal.

**Bitcoin does not benefit beneficiaries of the fiat pyramid scheme. Tax-dodging billionaires who get free money from the government making the rest of our money worth less are at the top of the pyramid and they're loving it!** ***(credit iTruth84)***

[Billionaires reap all the benefits from inflation. All the ill effects are dumped on us!](https://preview.redd.it/yy6mpz4lu4b71.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=baf557f19b9a2c939b1dc4b6b2f66db4143f23d7)

Bitcoin,Why Bitcoin adoption would be good for the environment and make a better world.,"Food for thought... Hear me out. I'm sure I'm not the first one thinking about this, but as I see, if Bitcoin was the global reserve currency, one of the effects it would have on our world is that we would have less junk and useless stuff. Less plastic less trash and in general, people would buy less things and those thing would be things that is really needed. 

If people know they money will worth more over time (even if it's just by a little) they will not spend it on useless stuff that they don't really need. That would make entrepreneurers pursue projets and products that are actually useful or at least quality and valuable. 

Meaning that eventually production of stupid and useless junk would stop, and by time, there would be no junk (or at least t much less) that is polluting our oceans and environment.

It's basically the result of deflation instead of inflation. What are your thoughts? Would this be one of the results of adoption?",1626251882,ODready,True,1,5,2021-07-14

Bitcoin,Up to $2300 worth of stocks! Limited time only promotion from Webull.,"This is a no brainer promotion for everyone serious about starting a business or in need of initial capital right now, check it out. 

Webull is a SEC registered, SIPC insured broker (up to $500,000 in securities insurance), known for being the biggest competitor to Robinhood and one of the biggest investing apps in the app store. They have awesome features and a really beautiful app/user interface. I would highly recommend the app to everyone interested in investing. They blow Robinhood out of the water in every single way possible.

They have a limited time promotion going on right now: Register an account with the link below and get 2 stocks worth up to $2300. 

For the first stock, you don't need to do anything. Just create an account using the link. To claim the second stock, you need to deposit $5 into the account. Once funds are settled, you can claim the stock.

If you're not interested in investing, i'd still recommend signing up just for the cash. You don't even have to use their app, you can just sell whatever stocks you get from the promotion when the stock market is open during the week and transfer the money back to your account. And then spend with whatever you want, or transfer the money to your brokerage of choice.

Bitcoin,EXPOSED: Tesla lost its carbon credits market in Europe so it's trying to create a renewable credits market by attacking Bitcoin mining,"I'm going to try to explain Elon Musk's seemingly ""big brain"" but actually pretty dumb gambit with regards to Bitcoin mining. Note carefully the dates on each development in the story.

Why did Tesla buy $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin?

Couple of factors - one short-term and one long-term.

**Short-term play** \- Tesla's production was halted due to supply chain effects from the pandemic. This is why there has been a lot of delivery delays this year. This meant that Tesla's shrinking profits from selling carbon credits to other carmakers alone wasn't enough to post a profitable quarter. So Tesla decided to buy Bitcoin and then sell some of it before the end of the quarter to make up for the shortfall.

[Bitcoin purchase ensured profitable Q1 2021 for Tesla](https://preview.redd.it/2cbuwb9xt4b71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f26f8d68c1e3d87def0783972627696905d5368)

**Long-term play** \- The reason for Tesla's revenue from carbon credits sales shrinking is that European carmakers are shifting focus to EV themselves, meaning they no longer need to purchase credits from Tesla to comply with strict emissions regulations in the EU.

[2020 was Tesla's first-ever net-positive year thanks to soaring carbon credits sales](https://preview.redd.it/4xyofb47u4b71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=821d0344237233cc0322cf0daa03bb0c0282e66f)

[But that source of revenue is now shrinking \(May 6\)](https://preview.redd.it/cqcxl5kbu4b71.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4121b24c5321d3530eb4e306d0da98193446a3f)

So Tesla now needs to make up for this potentially permanent revenue loss. What do they do?

**One day before Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin payments due to** ***""rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions""*****, Tesla applied for renewable credits certificate from the EPA.**

[Tesla applied for renewable credits one day before Bitcoin mining FUD \(May 12\)](https://preview.redd.it/bxtcrpigu4b71.png?width=1025&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3a8106383a5b92051bde86f2136fdcc5f2932ab)

Unlike carbon credits, the EPA's renewable credits can be sold in the open market to ANY industry. Elon figured he could create a new renewable credits market out of Bitcoin mining.

Too bad for Elon Bitcoin mining uses 4x higher than the average share of renewables in the US (56%)

The dumbest part of all this has to be the use of ""and transactions"" because no incremental energy is used for transactions. This guy frankly has zero understanding of how Bitcoin works.

Personally, I don't think he cares to understand. Notice how he's trying to hijack dog coin and turn it into PayPal.

I am currently unemployed because of Covid so I would not be able to buy bitcoin like anyone else. So please refrain from going there, I just want to be to secure my future and I am trying to find ways to do it, including doing research on this.

Bitcoin,The one and only attack vector on Bitcoin is a cyber attack on the grid.,"We've already had a cyber attacks in the beef and oil industry and then bitcoin starts taking the heat from media outlets and politicians and is to blame for the attacks.  The World Economic Forum has been preaching that the next big thing are Cyber attacks and it's supposedly going to be bigger than covid.  Right now we are in the midst of a great transition from China being the mining super power to potentially the US being the next mining super power.  If there is a cyber attack event in the US, in which the damages will be bigger than covid, then that can take out possibly over 60% of the hash power leaving the network potentially vulnerable.  That right there is an attack vector for someone but not only will it take out the hash power, but it is likely that the media will blame Bitcoin for the outages. They will spew a bunch of bs about it's energy consumption and say that's why we have no air conditioning.  They'll say it's because of those damn greedy bitcoiners.  The public will believe them because they always outsource their thinking to ""experts"" and there will be an outcry.  Our politicians will attack bitcoin with anti bitcoin bills that contain extreme ESG compliance laws that attempt to subvert the bitcoin network by controlling the American miners.  Then if American politicians have a way of controlling all American miners while America holds over 60% of the hash... then that's not good.

&amp;#x200B;

I think all too often we think Bitcoin is invincible.  It's foolish not to think the state has plans to subvert bitcoin.

I'm not gonna share my full story but it's like many of yours. At first I checked all the time to track dips to deploy my funds. But once my money was invested the behavior persisted. I had no intention of how often to check, so it just kind of happened. Dozens of times a day. See green, be happy, see red, heart starts pounding and feel bad. All day every day. Very distracting!

I'll suggest the correct frequency to check the Bitcoin price is once per day. Never checking your money is irresponsible. Checking once a day is reasonable. And there's something magic about once a day. It gives you a small thing to look forward to and something to practice delaying gratification. Will you check first thing in the morning? Probably not, you'll want to push it back until later in the day. 

If you are in Bitcoin, you're going to have to delay gratification. It can take years to make significant returns or even be in the green. So you can wait one day to check. It's good practice.

Bitcoin,Think there will only ever be 21 million BTC?‚Ä¶ think again‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs already way more in circulation,"I know a bunch of crypto hodlers hope BTC will rise to the moon. 

Here is one reason why it probably won‚Äôt, and one you should be familiar with. 

Step 1) start an exchange. 

Step 2) sell fake BTC to anyone sending you real cash, and store it on an exchange based wallet.

Step 3) show the person they are now in possession of some BTC, despite them not having any. 

Rinse and repeat 2 million times.

99% of people storing their crypto will never pull out. Most keep it ‚Äúsafely‚Äù stored on your exchange. 

For the 1% that actually do want to cash out, simply use the money the other 99% sent you and purchase the BTC they wish to withdraw. 

To avoid too many people withdrawing at once, place strict withdrawal limits and in a worst case scenario, claim ‚Äútechnical difficulties‚Äù until demand dies down or until BTC becomes cheap enough that you can process the withdrawals. 

End result: way more people now think they own BTC than they actually do.
People trade all that fake crypto on the exchanges, and set a price that is mostly determined by all that fake BTC. 

Those that actually possess BTC set their prices based on what they see on these centralized exchanges, and thus, the market price remains heavily manipulated to the downside. 

All these centralized exchanges are essentially one big Ponzi scheme.",1626231423,Buggy3D,True,1,41,2021-07-14

Bitcoin,Up to $2300 worth of FREE stocks. Limited time only promotion from Webull!,"This is a must have for anyone that is starting to invest in crypto right now.

Webull is a SEC registered, SIPC insured broker (up to $500,000 in securities insurance), known for being the biggest competitor to Robinhood and one of the biggest investing apps in the app store. It also allows you to buy the majority of cryptocurrencies available in the market. They have awesome features and a really beautiful app/user interface. I would highly recommend this app to everyone interested in investing. They blow Robinhood out of the water in every single way possible!

They have a limited time promotion going on right now: Register an account with the referral link below and get 2 free stocks worth up to $2300!

For the first stock, you don't need to do anything. Just create an account using the referral link. To claim the second stock, you need to deposit $5 into the account. Once funds are settled, you can claim the stock.

If you're not interested in investing in crypto, i'd still recommend signing up just for the free cash. You don't even have to use their app, you can just sell whatever stocks you get from the promotion when the stock market is open during the week and transfer the money back to your account. And then spend with whatever you want, or transfer the money to your brokerage of choice. 

Obs: To get two stocks, it has to be done through a referral link. Otherwise, you will only get the one you get from depositing $5 into the account.

Bitcoin,"Why Core does not support the ""spawn a wallet with 12 words"" format?","For instance in Electrum when you create a wallet you can spawn your wallet anywhere on the planet by remembering 12 words. This is insanely useful. With Core you have to carry a wallet.dat, and then encrypt this file and try to hide it somewhere safe. You can't cross borders with encrypted data since they stop you on customs check, airports, etc. If you upload the wallet.dat online even if temporarily and encrypted it is a risk because it got saved on some HDD server.

Anyway my point is, why you can't do this in Core exactly? 

What i've found related to this is this:

[https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/88237/is-there-a-reason-to-why-bitcoin-core-does-not-implement-bip39](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/88237/is-there-a-reason-to-why-bitcoin-core-does-not-implement-bip39)

Andrew Chow explained how BIP39 isn't considered secure and that is why Core does not implement it. But then he also explains Electrum does not use this anymore, yet Electrum still gives you the option to spawn wallets with 12 words. On the Electrum website they say:  ""Electrum 2.0 derives keys and addresses from a hash of the UTF8 normalized seed phrase with no dependency on a fixed wordlist."". So the question would be, why isn't Core using this method for wallets then? Electrum devs still consider secure the ""show 12 words for seed"" method when creating wallet, why not Core?",1626214204,cryptomann1,True,1,19,2021-07-14

Bitcoin,Optimistic thought...,"Could it be that the ancient value system that is overly corrupt today was the only way to move forward economically with the resources they had at that time? And then over time new generations born into money manipulated themselves subconsciously to believing they are the elite which turned to corruption and manipulation of the government? The government didn't get created for evil, they originally created themselves for the protection of value. They gave power to the smart people that found ways to store value only to get controlled by them later on. Maybe Satoshi are the governments taking back control from the shadows? Or maybe the people that started it all knew corruption would be part of life but it was still the only way to get economies going at that time and now we finally have enough global peer-to-peer power of information to stabilize the corruption and concentrated power. What purpose could the government have for making your life miserable? The happier we the people are, the less headache they have, the less fear of anarchy and death they face, the less hard decisions and loss of sleep(the non-corrupt ones) they face... This may be a very childish thought process, I didn't even know how a credit card worked until 3 months ago, so this is a point of view created by true life ignorance :) but still happy thoughts.

Bitcoin,I Don't Want to be My Own Bank,"There's a funny little quip when people get mad after they lose their coins:

""I want to be my own bank.""

""I lost the keys to my bank.""

It's tongue-in-cheek, but it's actually quite accurate. Being your own bank is a ton of responsibility, and if you wanted that, you pay the price if you mess up.

But I, and I think many other people as well, really *don't* want to be our own bank. We're very happy to pay a small fee for someone else to store, manage, and secure our wealth.

Banking itself is not the issue. Banking is a useful, free-market evolved service that many people (like myself) absolutely love. All I need is to hold my wealth in a *currency* that isn't controlled by someone else.

Let's say the risk free return on capital is 6%. I'd be happy to take 4%, and have whoever does my banking take 2%. It'll be someone super familiar with private keys, and backups, and scams, and hackers. That's what I want. To pay for a banking service the same way I currently do, but a service built on top of a non-inflationary, decentralized asset.

I think being your own bank is *extremely* overrated, and ""not your keys, not your coins"" is not a tenable long term situation. It puts an extremely large burden on every citizen to spend hours and hours studying security and technology, just to secure their wealth. It ignores the entire driver of modern civilization: *specialization.*

No one can print more Bitcoin. The ability to create currency out of thin air (or essentially free credit) and give it to your constituents is the real problem. Banking itself, again is simply a useful, free-market industry which there will still be plenty of demand for in a Bitcoin world.

I think ""banking"" and ""central banking"" have gotten confused over the last decade. Every industry is corrupted when it's in bed with government, and banking is no different. Banking itself is not the problem, and banking built on top of a deflationary currency should be quite a useful service in the future.",1626205720,JohnnyBlack22,True,1,93,2021-07-14

Bitcoin,Police arresting people involved with money laundering using cryptocurrencies,"The blockchain is public and this in my opinion is the reason why most of these arrests are successful. Wallets can easily be traceable with professional help.

However, just because cryptocurrencies are one way of storing and moving value it doesnt mean crypto is BAD! criminals will ALWAYS find ways to commit crime and crypto is just another option. 

Dont BLAME crypto for making this way of life easier!

Criminals will always be criminals but at least with BLOCKCHAIN tech we are able to keep our eyes opened for any misuse.

Crypto is the future and will be here to stay; this is just the beginning.

Back in 1994, Amazon started in a garage and with the help of investors developed a great website which back in the day the Internet was just consolidating and what kind of foundation did websites have back then? There were lots of scamming websites, practically every email inbox was filled with spam.

Fast forward 27 years and most people are aware of the problems mentioned above BUT the internet got regulated; we can easily confirm if a website is a scam or not just by googling it.

Of course there are coins that are for pump only but most companies that have their own coin have a goal in mind with its own environment to run.

Imagine going to a DMV without physically carrying any form of ID and being able to get an ID replacement by just logging in through a blockchain that has all your info saved... They would scan your fingerprint/eyeball/signature to confirm your true identity...

Carrying wallets, money, documents etc in public is not safe in many places of the world and very few places you are able to do so. 

In other words, crypto is here to revolutionize the world.

Blockchain tech just needs regulation, education of its use and adoption.

Slowly and more importantly the environment will strive if we dedicate 100% renewable energy to the crypto industry.",1626195192,matadordedweeb,True,1,4,2021-07-14

Bitcoin,Noob questions about BTC,"Guys, before I invest all my lunch money into BTC I want to ask you if you could share your wisdom on BTC future. As far as I understand, it is believed that BTC can (will/should) become a primary transaction medium like fiat money. But there are few things that bother me:

1) Volatility. It is impossible to plan you investments with such crazy volatility and unpredictability of BTC value. How can we avoid it?

2) No easy way to balance the amount of circulating BTC. It is inevitable that some BTC will always be lost due to human and technical errors, but the complexity of mining always goes up (or do I get it wrong?). It means that there will liquidity shortages and no way to smooth it or is there?

3) Very slow transaction speed. Ok, the speed is much better than bank wire transfer, but if I want to buy a cup of coffee, I want an instant transaction. Is it possible to achieve with BTC?

4) Energy waste. BTC mining looks like an incredibly wasteful business. You literally waste energy and equipment. Is there a way to transform mining into something useful?",1626194183,fatum4eg,True,1,15,2021-07-14

Bitcoin,3 Reasons Why a U.S. Bitcoin ETF Will Be Approved Soon And Be The Next Major Catalyst,"**1. Regulation Could Clear Way for Bitcoin ETF**: Senator Warren's request that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler develop a regulatory framework for crypto exchanges could be a blessing in disguise for the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC may be delaying approval due to U.S. government concerns about crypto. Warren asked Gensler to respond by the end of July, which could finally get the ball rolling on crypto regulation. The SEC likely can't approve a Bitcoin ETF until government officials are satisfied with crypto regulation, and the push from Warren could speed up the process.

**2.** **An ETF Fixes Deviations From NAV**: Bitcoin ETFs already exist around the world, and all of them use crypto exchanges without problems. However, U.S. fund investors can only get Bitcoin exposure indirectly through Grayscale's GBTC, a private trust. It has a limited number of shares outstanding so can't be arbitraged, causing the price to deviate from its underlying NAV. This wouldn't happen in an ETF because shares can be created and destroyed. Bitcoin is volatile so an ETF structure would likely track it well.

**3.** **Fourteen Filings Await SEC Approval**: The longer the SEC delays, the more ETF filings it will face. There are already 13 from issuers. Almost all have filed for an ETF that would store Bitcoin physically, like GLD and gold. Grayscale also filed to convert GBTC into an ETF, which brings the total to 14. More issuers are likely to file soon to help meet the estimated $20-$40 billion in pent-up demand that may flow into Bitcoin ETFs in their first 3-6 months. Bitcoin ETF assets could eventually top $100 billion. (*Source: Bloomberg Intelligence)*",1626189327,aLebanese,True,1,1,2021-07-13

Bitcoin,"AGRA WOOD POLSKA SCAM, FREELANCE GRAPHIC DESIGNER IDENTITY THEFT AND FRAUD, Bitcoin, TOMASZ NOWACZYK, TOBY LAURIE,posbit.io, Upwork, Telegram","Hi all!

My goal is to ruin scammers fraud activities that affecting us Freelancers and making our proffesion harder than ever before! 

Scammers: Toby Laurie, Tomasz Nowaczyk 

Scam company: Agra wood Polska

I was literaly one step before loosing money (unfortunetley they do have my ID and adress as I was blinded enough with their legit scam and signed on their scam bitcoin website).

Update on their scaming organization:

I was approached via Upwork platform as I am freelancing with them. The guy's who send me a proposal is Toby Laurie. This time it is about a polish company ""Agra Wood Poland"". (My research showed that this is their another scam as there are freelancers being approached by them, only using different names via LinkedIn)   Ha! Funny enough I am Polish based in UK, so I did a research and the company acctually exisist, so the whole thing seemed to be legit! He even passed me to talk details with a CEO of the company Tomasz Nowaczyk (which funny enough it is a real person and registerd as CEO of the fellow company in Polish FCA). ... I must admit they are on top of their game stilling people's identity or creating a content for a perfect scam.

Here it is the proposal (entry to scam you) I copied form Upwork posted by Toby Laurie:

""We are a Polish manufacturing company. We manufacture wooden pallets. Our product is in great demand in the B2B market. But we want to grow even more and capture new markets, for this we need a new visual shell. First, we need to draw a logo, we do not yet have a clear vision of what we want, but we have a clear idea and positioning of our company, so I think this is even better than just pictures. I will consider vacancies for a designer of any level, since in my opinion sometimes you should look at a business under a new, not spammed look. Therefore, if you are a hardworking and responsible designer. We will be glad to work with you.""

[https://www.upwork.com/ab/proposals/1399460237845106688](https://www.upwork.com/ab/proposals/1399460237845106688)

It is very disturbing as they seem to expand their ""business"" to the platforms that I thought would be safe for us freelancers. 

Now looking back I can see I've ignored so many red flags. After finding other frelancers posts I noticed they have the same pattern for approach, wich is a Frellance platform, than taking you to Telegram climing that is the only trust worth platform to comunicate to have long negotiations and consulations (erning trust), being so professional at all times (masters!), they will waste your time on creating contracts and questionaries to finally offer you a 10.000 euro for a logo and brand identity, and of course payment in bitcoin only. The only thing that might vairy is the country of the ""business"" and names of people involved in this.

Until the first main part everything seemed to be perfect. Contract was signed, the qestionaries explained and briefs sent. Basicly the payment was the only last step before kicking off with the project. 

I provided them with my BTC wallet and this is where things became shady.

I should of stop in the moment when Tomasz said he has limitations on withdrawing BTC to external wallets, so in order to proceed with the project I have to sign with [posbit.io](https://posbit.io/)(do not ever do it-its a scam). I did it and day after I gegreted it bit time!

This website is well done. I had to ask for help my friend who is trading cryptocurrency full time to verify them as there is almost nothing online. That moment I found out they are nowhere to be registered in FCA in UK and he never came accross them, which is obviously so odd if you are a real business!! 

To get y'all a bit more familiar with a fake trading crypto site, this what happens:

When you try to withdraw BTC they will tell you to trade it through their ""trusted exchange sites"" such as payeer or bestchange-please don't. They are fakes and will always ask you to put money in first in order to trade their fake bitcoin, to simply collect the missing puzzels and collect all your personal data (as they already have your ID and adress, da...).

 Let me paste the message from their ""support memeber"":

""Greetings! Our System has no commission for Withdrawal, and also performs fast transactions. However, it does not support fiat currencies, but only provides access to the work of these cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, USDT and Ethereum. In order to withdraw funds to a Bank Account or PayPal, you can, for example, use an online exchanger (you can find it here Bestchange.com) or a multi-currency Wallet (for example, Payeer.com). You need to use Withdraw Tab, where you need to specify an External Bitcoin Wallet (exchanger Wallet or your External Bitcoin Wallet). By withdrawing funds to an External Wallet in any way that we wrote about above, you can Withdraw your BTC to USD.""

And if you will try to tranfer a bitcoin to your external wallet (where real bitcoins are) they will pull out this thing with you having only 95/100 points on their website and in order to withdraw money you have to deposit 0,025 btc (another attempt to steal your credit card details to have a full set needed to trade your identity). Without this last missing puzzle they can't do much. However you still want to prevent the worse just incase and report a fraud with the gov insitutions in your country. Also just to be extra safe I would advice you to put an allert on your credit score apps to prevent a hacking attacks traight away. 

Quoted message from their ""support"" when asked how can I connect my trusted external wallet to reansfer BTC:

""Thanks for your waiting. We apologize for the delay in replying. Your account has been successfully verified, however according to clause 12.1 of our Terms &amp; Conditions, the System uses a scoring model for assessing the security quality of the User's account based on more than 170 internal and external publicly available behavior parameters, technical data and other internal corporate metrics. The maximum possible score for the security of the User's account is 100 points. Your account's security quality score is 95/100, which means that you have almost the maximum level. However, according to clause 12.3. of our User Agreement: ""Wallets whose balances have reached at least once the amount 0.15 BTC (or the same value in other currencies) can Transfer Funds from Posbit Account into an External Account and Internal Addresses only with an account security level of 100 (security level is an internal scoring model for assessing the security quality of Posbit system accounts)"". Thus, you need to get 100 of the account's security quality score. To get it, You should link your External Account to Posbit Account. To link link Your External Account to Posbit Account, You need to make a Deposit of the exact amount of 0.025 BTC from External Account. This Deposit will be credited to Your Bitcoin wallet and will be available for withdrawal immediately after crediting. After linking Your Bitcoin wallet, Your account will have 100 points of account's security quality score and, accordingly, the withdrawal of all types of crypto currencies will resume instantly.""

I was lucky enough to step back from it in last minute but I know many of my fellow freelance designers weren't lucky enough and lost money with them identity thiefs...

Now I am on the process reporting a crypto fraud and hopping that my adress and ID won't be affected. However I will probably spend extra time making sure that it won't happen..

Dear Guys, I know it is tempting to get such a great deal from someone aspecialy during this unconvinient times and it is so easy to go with the flow as the great opportunity was offered, but please think and research a person/business three times before you find yourself in the corner!

Always ask second opinion, make sure your potential client is willing do zoom video chats and they have no problem with payments to your trusted wallets, a specially if you are taking payments with BTC.

Stay creative! Stay safe!

Taproot unlocks the seamless integration of the application layer,"If you can imagine a scenario where an altcoin somehow ""flippens"" Bitcoin, then you really don't understand why Bitcoin holds value to humanity.

[How they steal your Bitcoin. Remember the Bitcoin ICO? Right, there wasn't one!](https://preview.redd.it/0rfw58rlbza71.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f80112ec07e750706a764f258ed4e2f61a14f836)

**Bitcoin is the culmination of humanity's 7000-year quest to perfect a democratic, disintermediated system for value exchange**.

It separates the monetary system from the state/central entity and sets every man in the world free from other men.

[ Central banking: The last vestige of slavery ](https://preview.redd.it/hksrkimr2za71.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47682fe3a840261ce50bd115d75728929a0da108)

There are three fundamental properties of Bitcoin that altcoins will never have because all altcoins compromise on one or more of these fundamental non-negotiable aspects to market themselves as ""better"" at the cost of security.

**Mathematically Infallible**

There is not an entity that's capable of enforcing change to the protocol or monetary policy in Bitcoin. Nobody can change Bitcoin's monetary policy, period. The issuance rate 10, 20, 50, 100... years from now is known and nothing can be done to change it.

Other protocols have already shown how unreliable they are in this regard because a single person/entity is effectively in charge.

We've seen u/vbuterin repeatedly meddle with his coin's protocol direction and monetary policy. If Buterin wakes up tomorrow and goes ""let's cancel PoS"" or ""let's cap the supply"", then you bet your bottom dollar that will happen.

**Real-world Cost Input**

No barrier to entry to participate in the issuance and distribution of coins. You can buy a miner and start mining even if you have 0 sats. The cost input is not a barrier.

The recurring cost input from miners is what links Bitcoin to the physical world and makes sure that miners don't just hoard the coins they mine but are forced to redistribute them. Bitcoin's network architecture, interface with the physical world and difficulty algorithm are key components of Bitcoin's meticulous game theory equilibrium.

This is one of the reasons POW is indispensable. With POS, there's no link to the physical world and the rich keep getting richer without any real-world cost to cover.

**Self-verifiable Truth**

This is arguably the most important aspect of Bitcoin. The cost to run a full node is very cheap. Because it's cheap, you don't need to run your node on centralized cloud servers like AWS which happens with almost all altcoins.

This was the crux of the blocksize wars and why Bitcoiners went to war with miners and corporate interests in 2017 and unflinchingly defended the right for every person to be able to run their own node.

If you're not able to run your own node because either the cost is prohibitive or the consensus model doesn't allow it, then you're not really free from other men. You're not verifying the truth yourself and you're delegating trust. We already have a system that involves delegating trust - the fiat monetary system. What's the point of going from bankers to anonymous ""validators""?

**Bitcoin Beyond Money**

Lastly, when you talk about other utilities beyond money, the reason Bitcoin doesn't have every new fangled thing you see on altcoins is that altcoins can afford to experiment and fail, Bitcoin cannot.

u/vbuterin's project is basically one failed experiment to the next - ICO to kitties to STO to DeFi (but actually CeFi) to NFT to dog coins...

Think of altcoins as testnets for Bitcoin. Anything worthwhile will inevitably end up being built on top of the most secure POW blockchain in the world.

**Bitcoin's latest upgrade, Taproot, which is set to go live in November, allows any L2/sidechain contract to be executed as a regular transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain**. **This is huge!**

This means Bitcoin can have any ""utility"" protocol built on it without bloating the base layer and thereby making sure that even 100 years from now, it will remain cheap for anyone to operate their own full node.

**If we cannot run our own full node, we're not really free from other men.**

Bitcoin,"Traders are withdrawing 2,000 BTC from centralized exchanges daily"," The number of Bitcoin held on centralized exchanges has consistently fallen since late May, with roughly 2,000 BTC (worth roughly $66 million at current prices) flowing out of exchanges daily.

Glassnode‚Äôs July 12 *Week On-Chain* report found that Bitcoin reserves on centralized exchanges have fallen back to levels not seen since April, the month that saw BTC blast to its all-time high of roughly $65,000.

The researchers noted that during the bull run leading up to this peak, relentless depletion of exchange coin reserves was a key theme. Glassnode concludes that much of this BTC went to the Grayscale GBTC Trust or was accumulated by institutions, driving ‚Äúa persistent net outflow from exchanges.‚Äù

However, when Bitcoin prices slumped in May, this trend reversed as coins were sent to exchanges for liquidation. Now, the net transfer volume has moved back into negative territory again as outflows increase.

The report also noted that the proportion of on-chain transaction fees represented by exchange deposits declined to 14% dominance this past week, following a brief peak to around 17% in May.

On-chain fees associated with withdrawals saw a notable bounce from 3.7% up to 5.4% this month, suggesting an increasing preference for accumulation over sales, it added.

 

The fall in exchange reserves appears to have coincided with an uptick in capital flows to decentralized finance protocols over the past fortnight.

According to DeFiLlama, the total value locked has increased by 21% since June 26 as it climbed from $92 billion to $111 billion.

A Tibetan woman was carrying a bitcoin mining machine transferred from Xinjiang province on May 3, in Sichuan,China.

She moves skillfully, and the power cord in her hand is like a bunch of flowers.

At present, this photo is uploaded to the platform in the form of NFT, and the price is roughly a few and dozens of ETH, up to 2021 ETH.

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin price falls under $33K, but on-chain data hints at BTC accumulation"," 

As the pressures placed on the market by China‚Äôs cryptocurrency crackdown begin to subside and the Bitcoin (BTC) hashrate starts to show signs of recovery, traders are now focused on how the price will be affected by this week's¬†unlocking of more than $550 million worth of Grayscale's GBTC shares.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the early morning downtrend in BTC on July 12 continued into the afternoon as the price of BTC dropped below the $33,000 support level after bears took control of the market.

it's been a rough day since the cryptocurrency market is not going well

Many of you might agree with this haha...

So recently, I've been looking for a new business model that's emerging in the cryptocurrency market and found this ABP Token.

\[Asset Backed Protocol\] basically is a token specialized for real estate NPL. Based on block-chain technology, it works as a real estate-specialized investment platform. 

One of my friends introduced this idea of Asset Backed Protocol and I believe it is a high potential. It is a real asset unlike other tokens with vague values.

Currently South Africa is being LOOTED, literally. From food, alcohol, clothes, electronics, self storage facilities, ect.
Yes most of this might be insured, especially the big corporations being emptied, but if I was invested in this economy in any way, I could care less about anything being insured when the masses will come back and empty the store room of every shop in major malls.

Have a look at what is happening in South Africa.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Transaction Fees Dropped Due to These Main Reasons,"In recent months, not only the price of Bitcoin has fallen, but the current cost of using the network , the transaction fees, is also falling.

On July 10, the average bitcoin transaction fee fell to $3.92. About three months ago, on April 21, the bitcoin transaction fee hit a historical record of $62.78. According to data from BitInfoCharts, the last Bitcoin transaction fee as low as it is now occurred on December 23, 2020, when the average Bitcoin transaction fee was $3.61.

Bitcoin has experienced a moody year. The average transaction fee in April this year was the highest in history. It is indeed very abnormal. It is important to know that the only time Bitcoin approached the record high fee at the time was on December 23, 2018, when the average transaction fee was $52.18. Things is that the price of Bitcoin hit a record high [of $64,300 on April 14](https://st.didimessage.com/jraV), but the average transaction fee on that day was $29. But only a week later, the price of Bitcoin dropped to around $55,000. At this time, the transaction fee hit a historical record of $62.79. As a result, more than 130,000 transactions were unprocessed on the network.

High fees often have a certain correlation with the high activity frequency of the blockchain network-when everyone scrambles to make bitcoin transactions, the network fees will rise because they exceed the supply of miners. When investors are eager to exit the market, transaction costs will increase even more.

At this stage, Bitcoin seems to be less dramatic. According to data from Coingecko at the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is[$33,588.54, a decrease of 0.7%](https://st.didimessage.com/jraV)in 24 hours. Although there is still a long way to go compared with the historical high in mid-April, it has risen slightly from the previous few days.

In mid-May, when the three China Internet Finance Association, China Banking Association, and China Payment and Clearing Association jointly issued an announcement requiring a correct understanding of the essential attributes of virtual currency and related business activities, relevant institutions must not conduct business related to virtual currency: Financial institutions, payment institutions and other member units must effectively strengthen their social responsibilities. They must not use virtual currencies to price products and services, and must not underwrite insurance businesses related to virtual currencies or include virtual currencies in the scope of insurance liability, and must not directly or indirectly provide customers with other services. Services related to virtual currency, including but not limited to: providing customers with virtual currency registration, trading, clearing, settlement and other services; accepting virtual currency or using virtual currency as a payment and settlement tool; developing virtual currency exchange services with RMB and foreign currencies; Develop virtual currency storage, custody, mortgage, etc.; issue financial products related to virtual currency; use virtual currency as investment targets for trusts, funds, etc.

Immediately afterwards, Sichuan, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia also began to suspend bitcoin mining operations, and bitcoin computing power also plummeted. According to the Bitcoin Power Consumption Index of Cambridge University, since Sichuan stopped mining, global Bitcoin energy consumption has been reduced by more than half. Before the real ""crack"" of bitcoin mining in China, the global bitcoin mining energy consumption was as high as 130 TWh. If ranked according to the national energy consumption ranking, bitcoin energy consumption is among the world's leading. But since May, the situation has changed dramatically. Specifically, the energy consumption of the Bitcoin network has fallen by 51% since May 10: from an all-time high of 141 TWh to 68 TWh. The carbon footprint of the Bitcoin network previously exceeded 60 billion pounds of coal burned, which is equivalent to the annual average electricity consumption of 9 million households. But now, as the energy consumption of the Bitcoin network has dropped by more than 50%, the direct impact on the environment will also be reduced.

According to data from BitInfoCharts, Bitcoin's entire network computing power was about 97.53 Ehash/s on July 10, the lowest point since May 24, 2020.

There is no doubt that the regulatory effect is immediate. Bitcoin seems to have entered a state of ""inertness"".",1626145146,Formores,True,1,0,2021-07-13

Bitcoin,Tether. A trillion dollar question?,"Hi all,

Been taking an avid interest since the start of the year in the space and stumbled upon the Tether question through the Coffeezilla video. This is far and away the biggest short term threat that I can see to the space and don't believe it's being talked about nearly enough. What would be the fall out from Tether collapsing and is this in any way currently priced in?

The headline issue is that it's now clear that Tether is unbacked, with USDT in effect being printed out of thin air and added to the circulation (I accept this is no different to what central banks do however at least the bonds sold are backed by the government!). Upon minting this is then being used to buy i.e. bitcoin (or lambos and whatever else the Tether owners might fancy). 


Key evidence for concern:

- Tether is 3% backed by cash

- Tether has never been audit (sacked their auditor for asking too many questions...)

- Tether is supposedly one of the biggest users of commercial paper but those in the market have barely heard of them

- Run by dishonest owners who have a shared history of fraud


Why this matters:

- Tether is the most popular stablecoin (designed to be 1:1 USD). Stablecoins are the ‚Äòoil‚Äô of the crypto sphere, providing the liquidity on which crypto coins are traded.

- There is &gt;$60bn of Tether in circulation.

- Responsible for circa 50% of bitcoin trading volume.

- Used extensively as collateral in the space.


To my mind then the question is when rather than if this will blow up. Given these issues have been fairly apparent since 2017 it seems difficult to know whether we are talking months or years. Given this, if you‚Äôd exited the market back then you‚Äôd have missed the incredible gains seen over the last few years. However, how much this has been driven by the minting of Tether is unclear to me.

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on what the fallout from this is likely to be and what timescale we are likely looking at. I‚Äôd imagine that the chain of events could look like: a) fear spreads that Tether can‚Äôt be redeemed for USD and therefore people stop accepting it as 1:1 and it loses its peg, b) this has a knock on effect that drives its price down significantly, c) this drop in liquidity and collateral causes a sell off of bitcoin and a drop in the price.

I‚Äôve listened to the Coin Bureau ‚Äòrebuttal‚Äô and whilst I am mostly a big fan of his videos I don‚Äôt find he directly confronts many of the issues raised by Bennett. PS, I‚Äôm not a financial advisor.

Bitcoin,Announcement from Hive Blockchain. Huge to me!! some thoughts?,"HIVE Buys 3,019 High Performance Bitcoin Miners Increasing Production By 46% Immediately
 

This news release constitutes a ‚Äúdesignated news release‚Äù for the purposes of the Company‚Äôs prospectus supplement dated February 2, 2021 to its short form base shelf prospectus dated January 27, 2021. 


Vancouver, Canada ‚Äì HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. (TSX.V:HIVE) (Nasdaq:HVBT) (FSE:HBF) (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù or ‚ÄúHIVE‚Äù) is excited to announce the purchase and immediate hashing of 3,019 MicroBT WhatsMiner M30S dedicated mining computers, or ‚Äúminers‚Äù.

These new machines have an aggregate hash power of 264 Petahash per second (PH/s).  The integration of these miners into HIVE‚Äôs systems will be immediate upon closing and will increase HIVE‚Äôs overall Bitcoin operating hashrate by approximately 46%.

Next Generation Miner Expansion

With the addition of these 3,019 MicroBT M30S miners, HIVE‚Äôs aggregate operating hash rate increases from approximately 566 PH/s to 830 PH/s.  At the current difficulty and Bitcoin price these purchased miners will generate an additional US$80,000 in daily income.  Bitcoin continues to have a daily volatility of plus or minus 6% and investors need to be aware of this volatility.

The miners to be acquired in the transaction are already located onsite at HIVE‚Äôs facilities in Lachute, Quebec and Grand Falls, New Brunswick.  The miners are being purchased from Foundry Digital LLC (‚ÄúFoundry‚Äù), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Digital Currency Group (DCG) focussed on digital assets‚Äô mining and staking.  As part of the partnership, HIVE will contribute its Bitcoin hashpower to Foundry USA Pool going forward, whose other major customers include Blockcap, Hut8, Bitfarms and Foundry itself, among others.

Frank Holmes, Executive Chairman of HIVE stated ‚ÄúWe are pleased to be executing on a transaction that dramatically increases our mining capacity without any logistics delays.  Our entry into a North American mining pool furthers our goal of increased transparency and accountability with our partners.  Mining power is shifting from east to West, and we‚Äôre excited to be involved.‚Äù

Mike Colyer, CEO of Foundry said, ‚ÄúWe are excited to have HIVE as a partner for the Foundry USA Pool as we continue playing our part in securing the global bitcoin mining network.‚Äù

As consideration for the sale of the miners, Foundry will be issued cash and 1.5 million warrants of the Company, subject to regulatory approval. Each full warrant will entitle the holder to acquire one common share for C$3.11 for a period of 2 years.  Mr. Holmes said ‚ÄúFoundry is one of the most well-respected firms in the mining space, and we‚Äôre pleased to have them as investors in HIVE, the only publicly traded pure 100% green, low-cost energy miner.‚Äù

HODL Strategy

This new production will quickly accelerate building up our Bitcoin reserves.  Presently we hold 605 Bitcoin in cold wallets.  Our goal to get to one Exahash of Bitcoin mining by the end of August is now much closer with this addition of 3,019 high performance machines.

New Mining Pool

We will be joining Foundry‚Äôs mining pool which we believe is the best option for our investors.  Foundry USA Pool is based in the US, where we should see better transparency, accountability and competitive costs. 
 
A mining pool is a collective that allows Bitcoin miners to combine their hashing power, and achieve a steadier stream of coins.

Nasdaq Bell

The team of HIVE is pleased that we are in New York City today to ring the closing bell for HIVE‚Äôs new listing on the Nasdaq.

If we were talking about something disposable then it would not bother so much to think about this ... but we are talking about the hardest asset that man has known in thousands of years of state robbery, and the only salvation we have from this globalist and communist agenda that does not want us to have nothing and be happy while they are debasing the currency and impoverishing and stealing freedoms from hopeless people.

Please, many people have already been left out due to ignorance or lack of means that allow them to access to know Bitcoin in depth. Buy as many Sats as you can, inform your family or friends and if they don't want to know anything about it, at least stack more Sats thinking of your loved ones.

Bitcoin,Lost wallet [I know],"I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs a major llong shot, I‚Äôm trying to help out one of my moms friends but if the immediate feedback is it‚Äôs a lost cause then I‚Äôll delete the post. If something helpful comes along I‚Äôll leave it up for visibility.

Anyhoo, my moms friend had a broker friend post on Facebook about 8 years ‚ÄúEVERYONE SHOULD BUY BITCOIN RIGHT NOW!‚Äù And then he posted a link to some site you could purchase from. Apparently she trusted him and went for it and purchased a little over $40,000 in BTC which is likely worth many millions today. Now here comes the fun part, she of course doesn‚Äôt remember how she stored the Bitcoin or the site she purchased it from just that she had it in a wallet.

So far my suggestions were as follows;

-	Have her search her email she used to purchase the Bitcoin for: Bitcoin, crypto, recovery, phrase, transfer, wallet
-	Reach out to either or both of these companies and walk them through the little info you have to see if they can help;
-	https://keychainx.com/
-	https://www.walletrecoveryservices.com

There‚Äôs an obvious one missing which would be to ask the guy what site he posted, but of course he didn‚Äôt buy any himself and shortly after deleted the post cause the company he worked for caught wind and didn‚Äôt like it. So there‚Äôs no way to go back through his feed to find it and he doesn‚Äôt remember.

Well that‚Äôs it, really not much to go off of I know but it‚Äôs where we are. If anyone can suggest any websites that would be popular at the time that this layman would have know of that she could search her email for or if anyone has *any* other suggestions‚Ä¶literally anything, it would be greatly appreciated.

My wife as a trader, she reduced her average price every day just buy and sell. She already got 25% profit in the past 25. days. her average price right now is $24,800.

I as a HODLer, my average price still $55,000. 

As above, you already know what I want to tell you. 

I just thinking if the price pump, she will earn less than me. But you know, even the price go down to $25000, she still have profit. But me, I will lost more.

Elon Musk announced that because of some environmental concerns Tesla is not going to accept Bitcoin. Binance has been banned in the UK. China is in a constant state of war with crypto mining, which results in various restrictions and bans. Iran has also banned mining, because of the energy issues. 

Some may even see attempts of regulation as a threat to decentralization. On the other hand, it may probably be that the crypto world is taking a break to adjust to the new reality.

Bitcoin,About to open my first Bitcoin account any advice?,"Hey everyone,
Without getting to much into things or desires song everyone with my life history, I‚Äôm no longer willing to watch the world go by and work 24/7 for little to nothing except into an early grave.

I‚Äôm 27 and at the moment I have around ¬£1500 in savings, but some of this must go toward something that happened recently, which leaves me around ¬£980.

I‚Äôm going to take this and buy my first bit of Bitcoin, followed by buying ¬£10 a month from here on.

I know this sounds like a little, but it‚Äôs all I can afford and that‚Äôs why I am doing it. I hope that It can either help me afford more later and be able to work less so as not to leave my family to early, or to help my children (if it can‚Äôt help me) when/if I meet someone to have them with.

I know this won‚Äôt make me rich, I understand that I don‚Äôt have enough to change my life in a drastic way, but if I can allow myself a few more years and not end my life after working my self to the bone for others to get rich and have nothing to show for it, it will have been worth it.

This week has made me look at life in an entirely new perspective and I know nothing will change for me tomorrow, but if I start small now, maybe, just maybe I won‚Äôt leave others with the financial burden of disposing of me, after working for years, for nothing! 

What we have here is a broken world, and financially I know my life can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt change. But my mindset can! 

I can start a new way of thinking, infect my friends, my family and hopefully make one other person look at life and our system differently.
If I can change one persons view around me, bring them to Bitcoin, then I have been a success because then I can say that I have contributed to the downfall of the corrupt and broken system that leaves so many of us with so little.

Look after your families everyone, stay safe, spend time with those you love, give advice to those your care about and help those around you when you can.

I‚Äôm going to join coinbase now and open my first ever Bitcoin account and take the first step in changing the future , if anyone has any good advice for me please let me know and any tips that you wish you had when you took your first step onto Bitcoin.

Bitcoin,21 Million BTC in 50 years?,"So today I wiped my phone completely because I'm selling it.  This was after I transferred my videos, photos, etc to my PC.  It was only after that I remembered my crypto wallet was on my phone.  As of now, I'm not sure I've lost it completely, but it definitely got me thinking... for instance that one dude who had like 7100 BTC on a hard drive that he threw away years ago.  Unless he magically finds a way to locate that, that BTC is lost.  The 21 million BTC is now down 7100.  And I was thinking, what happens in 50 years?

In the next 50 years, any combination of the following is bound to happen.  Phones get wiped.  SSD/HD fail and die.  Phones get dropped into the Ocean/Lake/Abyss and are lost forever.  People straight up die without ever divulging passwords to their crypto.  Fires, floods, tornados...  In 50 years, is it possible BTC actually worthless because the supply has been lost for it to be a viable source of currency? 

I know someone is going to say ""supply and demand curve.""  But this is currency.  Unless the world is okay with trading in the 10\^-6 fractional btc range, I don't see it surviving.  Like... I created a crypto.  And there's only 1.  And I mined it myself.  So I am now the owner of that 1 crypto.  Is that 1 crypto now worth the value of the entire global economy?  Of course not.  Nobody wants it.  So sure, supply may go down supposedly raising the value, but I think that will have a similar effect on its demand as its ability to support itself as a source of currency without the global supply will also go down.

An online community can suffer from having too many rules. An overabundance of rules sends the wrong message to visitors and members.

Especially with the libertarian values Bitcoin was founded upon, this is clearly not ideal.

Bitcoin,Offline node + online node: how to receive and send - Bitcoin Core,"Hi, I have following security model

- only trust Bitcoin Core software
- computer OFF is always offline, it is not allowed to send out any information (besides the ~250 bytes generated from Core when I sendtoaddress from it)
- computer OFF can take in information in form of files (e.g. via read-only USB drive or such)
- I also can use other computer, like computer ON, that can be online, it can run Bitcoin Core too and it will therefore have the entire blocks store on it's disk and can record it to usb disk

How to

a) verify my account ballance on OFF node

b) sendtransaction from OFF node

The method that I know now is following:

- on computer OFF run two instances of Bitcoin Core, call them bitcoin-main and bitcoin-world (isolate them - other user)

- on bitcoin-main do getnewaddress and write it down

(some time later, when received payment)

- let computer ON sync blockchain (prune=0)

- copy blocks directory from .bitcoin on computer ON onto a large pendrive

- connect pendrive into OFF and copy-paste the blocks directory from pendrive into bitcoin-world ~/.bitcoin/ , then start this node

- connect the two localhost nodes, e.g. on bitcoin-main addpeer localhost:9888 to the port of bitcoin-world

- let bitcoin-main sync using data from bitcoin-world. it will fully verify this data, same as data from any peer over internet is verified

- now use getballance, listtransactions and sendtoaddress on bitcoin-main


Can this be simplified, especially skipping the part where you run 2 instances of node? 2 insntances are not so great for old laptops (memory, hdd space, cpu and all).

Ideally I would imagine to have option like

--add-external-blocks-source /mnt/pen/blocks/

that will work by creating a virtual ""peer"" that is added to my node, and this peer sends me all the blocks he loads form the files. Still, this would require to make sure that datafile-loading code is secure against the data being malformed in malicious way (I guess no one does that too much, since we assume it was written by our program anyway?)",1626097145,metalzip,True,1,7,2021-07-12

Bitcoin,BTC can only become an asset but cannot become a currency. Are there other reasons besides no endorsement of power and no inflation?,"The disadvantage of BTC is that it cannot be inflated, and inflation and deflation play a very important role in economic development. The fiat currency itself has a deflationary design, but it seems that fiat currency has never fully used the tool of deflation, and unlimited money printing seems to have become a consensus.

This is a very complicated issue. The Keynesian economic model itself is to allow inflation to last forever. There are human issues, social psychology issues, and economic and political issues. At the current world academic level, no one can fully answer this question. Inflation and the gap between the rich and the poor in the community, economic development, political choice, and the development of social productive forces are all unclearly related. If there is no inflation in this world, and only one asset can maintain and increase its value, then social classes will not flow, the gap between the rich and the poor will never change, and the productivity of society will always stop moving forward.

So I personally feel that the world needs assets that are always anti-inflationary, as well as a currency that is always inflationary, so that diversification of assets can maintain the orderly operation of society. If this orderly operation is interrupted, then it must be hkqg to welcome this society. If there is only one asset that neither depreciates nor appreciates, and the entire community has no benefits or risks, it can only be achieved by a communist society.

Who wants to clarify these complicated relationships? The next Nobel Prize in Economics and Nobel Peace will be his.",1626091980,Vairlee,True,1,33,2021-07-12

Bitcoin,Powerwalk your way to free BTC and ETH in the US and Canada,"Hey guys, I just felt like sharing this with you since I'm actually blown away that you can earn free BTC and ETH in 2021 through some Pokemon Go app. These assets are arguably the most valuable in the cryptosphere at the moment and even getting a small amount in exchange for walking somewhere and answering a 1st grade trivia question is completely absurd to me.

Anyways here's the app : [https://coinhunt.world/](https://coinhunt.world/)

You basically walk around collecting keys and open free crypto vaults containing a minimum of around 284 Satoshis and 4600 Gwei each. Some people on the CoinHuntWorld subreddit report making around 10$-20$ per week in BTC/ETH at spot price depending on the length of their commute. Factor in the potential future USD value of BTC/ETH and if this doesn't give you a raging hardon then I don't know what will.

It's available on GooglePlay and as a TestFlight Beta on IOs (seems like the Beta is full for now from what I'm reading but it should fully launch soonTM).

You can only withdraw your BTC/ETH to an Uphold wallet so I suggest waiting until they clear out the current fiasco or until the devs add another option for withdrawal.

Here's my referral code if you want a free BTC/ETH vault to send you off on your hunt : [https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Wa1g50Eg5R](https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Wa1g50Eg5R?fbclid=IwAR3aakabG2wvldCS-CsEtU4RFy6lSwRv7ln8QYd6q4P5kA2tiWIusGCaILM)

Happy hunting cryptofriends

Edit : What's the catch? Well you don't really know what they're doing with your geolocation data but plenty of other apps use that for free (ex : Google Maps) so might as well get something in return. From what I understand some retailers also pay to create traffic around their businesses (ex : McDonald's, Walmart, Target) so the app basically splits this with you. For me it's not really worth going out of my way to hit all the vaults around me but if I can scoop up some BTC/ETH to and from the grocery store sign me the fuck up!

I would also add that from a mathematical perspective, even if the amount you receive is relatively small, if your cost basis is 0 and you're not doing anything different throughout your day, your % returns are technically INFINITE.

Bitcoin,GBTC vs. Bitcoin,"GBTC is currently trading at an 11% discount to NAV. It hit 26$ on Friday, corresponding to a Bitcoin price of 27,300. Typically, during expansions there is not only no discount, but a 10-15% premium over NAV. When we do see a return to ATH, this could correspond to a ~25% arbitrage when compared to buying Bitcoin outright. 

Is there any legitimate reason to not just buy GBTC? Obviously the problem of ‚Äúnot your keys, not your Bitcoin‚Äù but is this really an issue for a regulated security with billions under management? This isn‚Äôt exactly Mt. Gox. The benefit I could see to owning Bitcoin outright is you could yield farm, but you‚Äôd be hard pressed to match that arb. return. Not to mention taxes are way messier that way versus owning a stock. 

The other concern is that grayscale takes a 2% fee. But, even if it took us 5 years to get back to ATH, you‚Äôd still come out ahead on the discount alone. Anyways, any thoughts on this are appreciated.",1626061536,JeffGDoubleE69,True,1,5,2021-07-12

Bitcoin,I made a Bitcoin valuation model that generates accurate Buy-Sell signals for trading,"Bitcoin has been called Digital Gold, a bank in Cyberspace, and also a Ponzi scheme. 

For this valuation model, the distinction doesn't matter. The thesis is that Bitcoin is at least as valuable as the total value stored inside it. 

If Bitcoin is digital gold, it can be valued similarly to Gold ‚Äì the more people exchange dollars for Gold, the more valuable Gold becomes in terms of dollars, and then the value of all Gold is equal to the total dollars exchanged for it. 

If Bitcoin is an E-Bank located in cyberspace, the logic is the same, you can think of it as a shared savings account between all owners, the balance of which is equal to the total amount deposited, and the amount of Bitcoin held by each owner is equivalent to the number of shares in the bank.

If Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, the fair value of a Ponzi is the same as the total amount investors have put in it. 

This leads us to the first component of fair value, which is the total amount deposited. This is also approximately equal to the Realized Capitalization. 

But ""Store-of-Value‚Äù is not all that Bitcoin is. With the advent of the lightning network and El-Salvador adopting it as a legal tender, Bitcoin has already cemented its status as a currency. In addition, because of its sovereign properties, it is also a call-option on becoming THE reserve currency of the world. 

For each day that Bitcoin resists attacks and doesn‚Äôt die, it further proves its value proposition, and the call-option trends towards becoming ITM (In-The-Money). 

This call-option premium is modeled with a regression with ‚Äòdays without dying‚Äô as one of its main predictors. This is the second component of the valuation model. 

The addition of these two pieces, the realized cap, and the call-option premium, leads us to a fair value of Bitcoin, denoted by the blue line in the chart below. Historically, cycle-tops have been approximately 3 MADs (Mean Absolute Deviations) away from fair-value, denoted by the red line, and cycle bottoms have been 1.5 MADs away, denoted by the green line. 

[Model outputs as of 7\/11\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/5dmxpkraroa71.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0f32ae490f14d28682603c8ca4daf3e2bee8521)

The green and red lines can be used as buy and sell signals. These signals are sparse as there have only ever been four buy/sell signals each in the history of Bitcoin, but they‚Äôve correctly identified ALL cycle tops and bottoms.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Newb. Trying to figure out GBTC.,"I know GBTC is problematic. Adds a whole extra layer of complexity to my upcoming investment. But‚Ä¶ it's a portion of my retirement account that I want to invest, and I find that in the US GBTC seems to be the only feasible option. Looked into Microstrategy. Impure play scares me. Would prefer BTCC, but Fidelity won't allow int'l trades for retirement accounts.

I'm thinking the next few weeks are the right time for jumping into GBTC, but I'm still confused about a few things.

&gt; The 6 month GBTC lockup is only for institutional investors getting GBTC shares at NAV, right? Doesn't apply to retail investors. Now that there's a discount to NAV Grayscale has closed the trust, but again this doesn't apply to retail investors just buying GBTC shares, correct? So, for retail investors you can jump in and out at will at any time?

&gt; Does anybody have any sense about whether the imminent unlock will result in expanding the discount to NAV or narrowing/eliminating the discount?

&gt; More on timing. I'm trying to wait as long as possible to buy in, not because I need BTC to drop to $20K, but because I have to liquidate part of another investment that is gaining and might spike this month. Anybody have any ideas about how long BTC might go sideways or what the risks are for waiting a few weeks (particularly in light of the GBTC unlock possible effect on BTC or GBTC discount)?

&gt; Does anybody have a feel for if/when GBTC converts to an ETF how that will go down and what the risks are to the discount to NAV will be if, say, other ETFs get approved first. Would seem like there would be a huge exodus from GBTC if it's not the first, or in the first simultaneous group approval of, ETFs. It would suck to find the share price plummeting against NAV when I'm trying to sell out of GBTC to get into an approved ETF.

Thanks to anybody who made it this far. I appreciate any help and insight you can give. The learning curve is crazy thanks to the SEC not approving any ETFs. I've spent more time trying to figure out Grayscale than bitcoin.",1626053236,LastFireTruck,True,1,25,2021-07-12

Bitcoin,GENUINELY NEED SOME HELP/ADVICE/GUIDANCE,"Hello I am looking for some guidance. I have recently taken advantage of this consolidation period and have fired a few large bullets at Bitcoin and a few other solid coins (Yes, I am newer investor in the space). My position is long as I believe global Bitcoin adoption is a very likely possibility. That said I wanted to pick the great minds of this thread, especially from those who have been here for a long time, to ask advice on what the right strategy is for the long game. I KNOW NO ONE CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE but I believe that history is generally a great indicator. 

So here is my question...HOW DO I APPROACH BULL RUNS?

My strategy is to basically continue to DCA into Bitcoin weekly and treat it as a long term savings bucket, pretty straight forward. 

Here is where I need some help... What do I do when the price skyrockets during a bull run. For example there is much speculation that Bitcoins price will spike at the end of this year and maybe into next. I guess I just need to figure out do I 

A) take profits during a bull run and redeploy those profits in a bear market? 

B) Don't sell anything and wait until the next bear market to DCA weekly?    

C) Just keep DCA every week regardless of price for the next 5-10-15 years? 

My goal is to STACK AS MUCH Bitcoin as possible and hold for the long run and I am just trying to figure out how to maximize my efforts during these times.

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin has been banned many times in many geographies, and yet today, adoption is outpacing internet adoption","An important quote from the board director of Blockstream and founder of Stillmark, Alyse Killeen. 

I've taken the time to collect and display the important points and subheadings from an article (linked below). 

**Intro** 

The death of cryptocurrencies has long been prognosticated and it is proving even harder to bring down this drive. Governments have started to reconsider their previous positions on their utility as some decide to adopt and regulate them as opposed to blindly opposing their use.

Despite being banned in some major countries such as China, Bitcoin has still held strong, which speaks to its strength and adoption. 

**Here are some lessons as to why these bans keep failing**

- You cannot ban the blockchain, its code
- Crypto is more than just about money, it‚Äôs fostering other technological innovations
- It's solving real financial problems where other systems have failed
- The world is changing and so is crypto
- No real reasons/fears to warrant ban

**Final thoughts**

Banning crypto is ill-advised. Instead, governments should seek to consider a crypto economy as the early beginnings of a new open financial system.

Bitcoin,"With governments classifying crypto as a ""national financial risk"" and banks cracking down on crypto, what is the future of Bitcoin?","Hello all. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am A new investor, who in a sense, FOMO'd in near the top (50ish-60k range) but have steadily DCAing small chunks into bitcoin only since the crash.I am a student, so don't have MUCH expendable income, but instead of buying weed/booze/going out, I just DCA into crypto now, study, and as soon as restrictions lift, I work out. 

Strategy wise on my end I do not intend to modify anything. However, I am deathly afraid of what governments and banks will do to crypto, and Bitcoin specifically. Idc if doggy meme coins get outright banned, good. I'm all for that. they should of been banned in 2017.

And I know that you cant ""ban"" bitcoin, and stop using it, but you can definitely stop adoption from taking place by making it economically unviable as an investment/store of value. (for example, MASSIVE taxes when making a purchase with crypto, or cashing it out - will make it ""unfeasible"" and virtually useless if the government takes the lions share of it, every time).

&amp;#x200B;

For a person that doesn't want to skirt around the government and risk repercussions is this a bad omen for bitcoin? The FUD is starting to rattle my outlook for the future with the way the FED and banks are treating crypto, and bitcoin specifically. 

Add on top of that the ""energy concerns"" and normies pile on board on the ""FUCK BITCOIN"" band-wagon. 

&amp;#x200B;

For anyone who is ""in the know"", what will the reprecussions of a ""worst case scenario"" be for someone like me?

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently down -30% from my initial investments, but as of right now I am still DCA in with very small amounts.",1626032702,resectioningzone31,True,1,42,2021-07-12
Bitcoin,Can someone help me gain access to my Bitcoin wallet circa 2011?,"Hello, I was wondering if someone could possibly help me get access to my wallet from when I dabbled with Bitcoin circa 2011

Here‚Äôs what I have on an old hard drive, and here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve tried:
 
 
‚Ä¢ I have the various folders associated with the Bitcoin core client, and in the appdata/roaming/bitcoin folder, there is a wallet.dat
**HOWEVER** I have no recollection of using the core client at all, and don‚Äôt even know if there is anything in that wallet or if this wallet was synchronized in some way to the other program I used. 
 
I downloaded/installed a new version of the core client, and tried to copy this old wallet.dat file into the appdata/roaming/Bitcoin folder of the new installation, however when I place it there the wallet.dat doesn‚Äôt show up in the Core Client program as something I can select and open. 

 
If I rename the file to anything else besides wallet.dat, it shows up in the list of selectable wallets, however ‚Äúopening‚Äù it seems to hang for an extended period of time without actually doing anything. So the current situation is that I‚Äôm not even sure if there‚Äôs anything in this wallet.dat, nor do I know how I can even check. 

 
‚Ä¢ what I actually used back in the day was a program called GUIminer, and I have all the folders associated with that as well. However I don‚Äôt see any sort of wallet.dat in these files. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs any other sort of file that a wallet used for GUIminer might be stored as. Or any sort of setting file or document here that might indicate what wallet my GUIminer client was mining to at the time. This is definitely the program I spent most time running though.

Bitcoin,The Bogdanoff Twins Claim They Participated in Helping Satoshi Nakamoto Build Bitcoin,"**Following the infamous meme that shows one of the Bogdanoff twins on the phone telling whales to initiate a crypto-market dump, the Bogdanoff brothers now claim they took part in inventing the leading cryptocurrency bitcoin with Satoshi Nakamoto. During an interview hosted on L‚ÄôHeure des Pros, the Bogdanoff twins said as mathematicians the two were able to ‚Äúparticipate in the elaboration of some of the source code.‚Äù**

## Igor and Grichka Bogdanoff Claim to Have Helped Satoshi Elaborate on Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚ÄòPredictive Code‚Äô

There‚Äôs been a long-running joke that the Bogdanoff twins have the power to manipulate crypto markets after a meme started a few years ago showing one of the twins ordering a substantial dump on the market.

The meme has been seen by the twins, according to a recent interview on L‚ÄôHeure des Pros and a recent appearance on the French television show ‚ÄúNon-Stop People.‚Äù Igor and Grichka Bogdanoff said they have seen the meme and explained that Satoshi Nakamoto probably has something to do with its online virality.

 ‚ÄúIt is probably Nakamoto who made \[the Grichka Bogdanoff meme\] circulate,‚Äù Igor Bogdanoff said. Igor further added: 

""\[The image\] was in all blockchains between 2010-2012 \[and\] downloaded more than 1.3 billion times.""

**Satoshi‚Äôs Alleged Acquaintance ‚ÄòSo√Øtchiro Shimoda‚Äô and the Two ‚ÄòAncient Bitcoins‚Äô**

The Bogdanoff twins are well known for their science-based television show called ‚ÄúTemps X.‚Äù Since the 1970s, the twins have been scientific essayists and while Igor has a doctorate in theoretical physics, his brother has a doctorate in mathematics.

During the recent interview with the Bogdanoff twins, the two explained how they had worked with the touchscreen inventor Fran√ßois Mizzi and an interesting Japanese scientist dubbed ‚ÄúSo√Øtchiro Shimoda.‚Äù",1626019576,_kr_saurabh,True,1,6,2021-07-12

Bitcoin,"one psychological reason people resist crypto, and ideas for how to change their minds","we have some idea about why those at the top tiers of the financial markets -- e.g., traditional financial execs, governments, wealthy investors -- resist and criticize the very notion of cryptocurrency: they want to retain the power and wealth they have been cultivating over generations. but what about the everday person, someone who does not hold a major stake in the financial game?  someone with modest-to-no savings? I'm talking about the blue collar workers, middle class families, ""retirees"" working another career just to keep the lights on,and those less tech savvy who may not have a basic understanding of the tech. I'm just thinking about normal, everyday people who may not be receptive to info concerning crypto and its unique benefits. why would they resist something that so clearly to many of us could put them on a path to financial security and independence? 

I'd argue that people's resistance to crypto largely -- but not exclusively -- stems from a core psychological phenomenon known as the status quo bias. the status quo bias refers to the (oftentimes irrational) propensity for people to favor the existing and longstanding states of the world. loss aversion, regret avoidance, repeated exposure, and rationalization can all contribute to this preference, among other deep-seated psychological mechanisms. these biases operate heuristically, forming barriers to cognitive and social change, and ultimately crypto adoption. 

a question I'm interested in is how can people reduce or overcome this bias? what can we, as early-ish crypto adopters and enthusiasts do to encourage others to break free from from their current mental state -- that in favor of traditional finance that they understand and with which they are very comfortable -- and at least begin to consider the possible benefits of crypto vs. the shackles of most of the world's current primary financial system? below are just a few tips you may be able to use to leverage psychological biases in others to increase the likelihood that they'll be open to, or invest in, crypto:

1. **Frame crypto in terms of loss avoidance**. another cognitive bias seen in many people is what's know as loss aversion. a perceived loss is seen as much more psychologically and emotionally significant than a perceived gain. In other words, losing $100 hurts much more -- psychologically -- than gaining $100 feels good. so perhaps framing discussions around the potential cost of sticking with the current financial system, rather than the many gains of crypto, would be useful. defer to what works best for you given your audience, but some ideas could include the demise of fiat, the low, low APR of traditional savings accounts, inflation, etc. basically, why is commitment to tradtinal finance harmful, especially as it pertains to your audience's specific situation?
2. **Appeal to emotions**. oftentimes when it comes to biases, people are driven not by careful deliberation, but by emotions. you can leverage this in your favor by appealing to certain emotions that you know might promote behavioral change with your audience, or simply common emotions seen across most individuals (e.g., fomo). for example, is the person you're talking to skeptical of powerful entities? use that to your advantage. highlight the concern (I.e., fear) of many that the few at the top dominate financial systems, and explain how defi could mitgate those concerns. People are driven by different types of emotions, so it's probably best to figure out what drives yours and tailor your message to that
3. **Highlight that crypto adoption is becoming a norm**. social norms have a huge effect in driving behavior. if you talk to someone about how commonplace crypto is becoming (e.g., wow, x number of new people are using crypto every single day; y % of people in your age group now use or want to invest in crypto!), particularly for others who share the same attributes with your audience, that could help persuade them more to see the benefits
4. **Highlight immediate benefits**. people are largely influence by immediate rewards, so if crypto can offer that (e.g., monetary credit for joining a platform), that could compel some to give it a shot, or at least look into it
5. **Wait until your audience has the time and mental energy to talk.** part of the reason why status quo bias exists is because it's easy. that is, inaction is clearly easier for people than action. after all, the form means they don't have to do anything! so, when talking to new people about crypto, make sure the context is right. make sure you both have the time to have a through discussion, and make sure they aren't tired or distracted by something else if at all possible. you want to have some confidence that they have the cognitive resources and time required to fully consider a new idea or action, and offer up some specific actions they can do to get started (e.g., send them a link to a good article on crypto)

once critical mass buys in -- at least to the idea that cryptocurrency has some value or traditional finance may not be all it's cracked up to be -- exponential growth can occur. social contagion will eventually take hold for good. it seems like we're headed on that path already (although I don't know what the data look like on that), but the more people buy in and the faster it occurs, the less likely it will be that the big players will be able to squash or hobble crypto's growth and adoption along the way. 

these are just a few ideas off the top of my head; it's not an exhaustive list. there are clearly lots of other factors and psychological biases at play, bot that underlie resistance to crypto and techniques that can help promote change, but I just wanted to give some here a starting point to break the crypto ice and get the conversatiin surrounding these issues going here. curious to hear others' thoughts. 

tldr: people prefer what they're comfortable with. if you want new people to consider crypto, highlight losses incurred with trad fin, appeal to emotions, describe crypto adoption as a norm, highlight immediate rewards of adoption, and wait until your audience has the time and energy to talk.",1626019044,nicky_papagiorgio,True,1,4,2021-07-11

Bitcoin,"""Only Invest What You Can Lose"" is Misleading | Debt is not Evil","There are a lot of young people on this subreddit becoming financially literate for the first time, so I'd like to share a few not so obvious things I've learned in the last 5 years that I *really really wish* someone had told me when I was 20.

# Everyone Invests, Some Just Don't Know It

You don't get a choice whether to ""invest"" or ""not invest"" your money. If you ""haven't invested"" your money, you've just invested in cash. In the United States, that means you've invested your money in the United States Dollar (USD).

For an ideal currency, leaving your money in the currency means that it doesn't gain value, and it doesn't lose value. It just remains there, with its same value, until you purchase with it. That's why, traditionally, people have thought of leaving money in cash as ""non-investment.""

There is *supposed* to be no risk to lose your value, and no upside to gain value. Key phrase: *supposed to be.*

When your Grandparents or older folks tell you things like ""cash is king"" or ""you should always have some cash on hand,"" they are giving advice which is drawn from their experience of a far different monetary environment than the one in which we currently live. Theirs was closer to the ideal, where cash really was risk-free, reward-free investment.

So ""only invest what you can afford to lose"" is quite misleading. Typically, the person telling you this is telling you to invest more of your money in cash, and less in other traditional ""investments."" This is an awful idea, because when investing in cash, you are guaranteed to lose. 

There is no investment strategy in the world that is immune to losing money, even cash. There is simply risk-reward for each investment. And in the current environment, cash is a particularly bad one.

# Cash is Trash

Today, cash is a high-risk, no-reward investment. Central banks are increasing the money supply at an astounding rate. In the United States, the money supply [increased](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL) by about 25%, or $5 trillion (a little more actually) in just 2020.

Money supply increase devalues the currency with respect to economic output:

* If economic output is stable, then a 25% increase in money supply means that 1 unit of money gets you 20% less than what it used to.
* Let's say the economy grew 25% with the money supply. Your 1 unit of money can now buy the same as it could before, except that you were entitled to have that money go *farther* as the economy grew, and that was taken away from you.

The point is to communicate to all young people that if you are holding cash, you are hemorrhaging money. A conservative estimate for the cost of holding cash over the next decade is 10% a year.

# Living Expenses

Old wisdom is to always keep at least 6 months living expenses on hand in cash. It's referred to, tongue-in-cheek, as ""fuck you money,"" the idea being that if you have to tell your boss to go fuck himself, you won't starve.

In the current monetary environment, you're paying a solid premium on those living expenses, about 5% / 6 months, in order to hold it in cash. Because of this, dropping down to 3 months, or even 1 month isn't so unreasonable. It's really, really expensive to hold money in cash, so decide how big  the risk of needing fuck you money is in your current job.

If you're happy, save some money and ditch the cash. Also, the best investment today is quite liquid, which brings us to...

# Bitcoin

Bitcoin is designed as the ideal money we talked about above. Eventually (we're probably 2 decades away from this), Bitcoin won't lose value, and it won't gain value. It will just *be.* If you have 1 BTC and you hold it for 10 years, it'll entitle you to the same amount of value when you spend it as you provided to the economy when you earned it.

Now, if economic output doubled in that time, your 1 BTC will buy twice as much, but that's still just the 1 BTC of value your initial labor entitled you to, because your labor contributed to that doubling.

Currently, only a very small fraction of the world understands that BTC is the store-of-value asset layer of the future, and so only $1 Trillion of the likely $200 Trillion that will end up there is already there. That's why BTC, *today* is an investment, and not merely money.

But BTC, fundamentally, is *not* designed to be an ""investment"" in the traditional risk-return sense of the word. It's designed to simply hold value over the long term, the way USD and other cash does not (because governments can print more of those at will).

As such, BTC is quite liquid. Even today, you can sell BTC on an exchange like Gemini and withdraw the corresponding currency in less than a day. That means that it would be totally reasonable to hold your 6 months living expenses in Bitcoin instead of USD, and simply sell the BTC if an emergency strikes and you need cash. That way, you capture the upside of BTC, and avoid bleeding 10%/year on your living expenses money.

# Debt and Inflation

The worse cash gets, the better debt gets, and vice versa. When the value of the currency denominating your debt is collapsing at 10% a year, that means that the real value of the debt you must repay is also collapsing at 10% a year.

I'm just going to say this outright: in the currently monetary environment, paying off something like a 6% fixed rate mortgage is a terrible idea. It's throwing away *at least* 4% of your money every year for no reason.

People don't seem to realize that all financial instruments also exist as their mirror, because of opportunity cost.

*Paying off* a loan to the bank is effectively the same thing as *giving a loan* to the bank. If you have a $100 loan, and you're paying $1 interest/year, after one year, you have -1$, then -2$, then -3$. The bank is gaining $1/year from you over the long term.

All you're doing when you pay that off is reversing who gets the $1/year. If you pay that off, and now you have $0, $0, $0, instead of -$1, -$2, -$3. *You* are now earning $1/year, with respect to the loan option, instead of the bank.

When you pay off a loan, you are loaning the bank. Would you rather you have $100 and the bank gets $1/year, or the bank has $100 and you get $1/year.

Ask yourself - in the current inflationary environment, do you really want to be loaning the bank your hard earned money for a paltry 6%? And the lower the interest rate, the worse that is.

# Summary - Opportunity Cost is Everything

Money doesn't exist in a vacuum. All uses of money must be compared with all other possible uses for that same money.

Cash is trash. You want to avoid holding it if at all possible.

Bitcoin is very liquid, it will probably appreciate, and it's engineered to maintain its value across time. It's a better vehicle than fiat (government created and printed) cash in every way.

In an inflationary environment, paying of debt is a bad idea. You'd much rather take a loan from the bank than give the bank a loan. Interest rates matter for this. If the interest on the debt is high enough, it still may be correct to pay it off.

Any interest rate under the rate of monetary expansion is essentially free money, as long as that money is placed in an asset that will hold its real value.",1626016167,JohnnyBlack22,True,1,121,2021-07-11

(Armed Forces Brewing Company)
SHARE
Robert O‚ÄôNeill, the former Navy SEAL who is widely credited with firing the shots that killed Osama Bin Laden, has a new mission: To get you to invest in a beer company. Specifically, this one.

On Thursday, a commercial for Armed Forces Brewing Company began making the rounds on social media after the company uploaded the full promotional video to YouTube featuring the SEAL Team Six veteran as he shoots bad guys off-screen, mocks beer snobs, and makes a last-minute reference to that time he got into a Twitter fight with an airline for refusing to wear a mask.
‚ÄúThis beer is for everybody to drink, it‚Äôs not some pretentious asshole beer for some slackster or coffee-house misanthrope,‚Äù O‚ÄôNeill says in the clip as he pulls a Spock and knocks out a guy wearing flannel because he likes hoppy beers. The advertisement itself is pretty standard fare these days, and it‚Äôs similar to the videos from veteran coffee and apparel companies that are already out there, and have been for a while, which is to say that it plays like a military-grade and mega-moto version of Dollar Shave Club‚Äôs 2012 viral hit. The video also includes a CGI flyover from a trio of aircraft ‚Äî that look a lot like Russian MiG-29s ‚Äî and the same woman appears to have been cloned several times over in different service-specific outfits.

The company‚Äôs investment page pledges to have at least 70% of its workforce be military veterans. The website lists O‚ÄôNeill as its brand ambassador and notes that he also serves on the company‚Äôs board of directors. The company‚Äôs onsite roster lists a number of other military veterans, from fellow Navy SEALs to former Army Special Forces.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud to work with some great Americans making great American beer,‚Äù O‚ÄôNeill said in a July 6 statement. ‚ÄúOur beers pay tribute to the men and women of the greatest military in the world, and I am thrilled that anyone and everyone can own part of this patriotic company at this early stage alongside me.‚Äù
According to their recent statement, Armed Forces Brewing Company was launched in 2019 and aims to raise $7.5 million in order to acquire a brewing facility ‚Äúto maximize production so the company can reach as many Americans as possible.‚Äù Investments in Armed Forces Brewing Company begin at $200, at $10 a share and come in different tiers with their own perks.
You can ‚Äúenlist‚Äù by investing $200 to $499, at which point you‚Äôll get a sticker, a challenge coin, an invitation to an annual event, a 5% discount at their online store and a few other benefits. From there the investments jump up quite a bit, as do the titles. There‚Äôs ‚ÄúBootcamp‚Äù which comes in between¬†$500-$999 and ‚ÄúBrigade‚Äù at $1,000-$4,999, and then it just keeps climbing. You can read a more detailed breakdown of the perks, here.
Now, I have to circle back because at first when I saw the ‚Äúenlist‚Äù option I was irritated, because it felt like one blatant attempt at over-the-top military branding too many. However, upon closer review, I realize it‚Äôs spot on. I mean, think about it. That‚Äôs not unlike enlisting: You get a challenge coin (because of course you do), an invitation to an annual event (like the birthday ball), a discount at a very specific set of retailers (the PX), and you might not get exactly what you expected out of it. So, hats off to Armed Forces Brewing for that one. I mean, I won‚Äôt be shelling out that much cash for a sticker and a few minor benefits, but I‚Äôm sure someone might.[Armed force Brewing Company ](de863755@gmail.com)",1626006381,Little_Coat_3971,True,1,0,2021-07-11

Bitcoin,A simple heuristic for when its the best time to buy Bitcoin: the 80% devaluation rule,"After analyzing the entirety of Bitcoin's price history, I came up with a simple heuristic for when it's the best time to buy Bitcoin. Note that this heuristic is not 100% accurate nor will it ever be nor is it guaranteed to work forever, but for now it gives a good idea on when you'll want to throw some money into Bitcoin and I have strong confidence that it will work for the next few price cycles given the investing/speculating behavior we've seen over the past few price cycles. This heuristic is what I call the **80% devaluation rule** and it goes like this: the best time to buy (and hoard) Bitcoin is when it has devalued at least roughly 80% from its most recent all-time high via a on-going crash; i.e. the current price of Bitcoin is roughly 20% of its most recent ATH.

I came up with this rule after analyzing the price history on [this graph](https://bitcoin.zorinaq.com/price/). Most other graphs of Bitcoin's price history only show data from 2013 onwards, but this one goes all the way back to the genesis block.

Here is a list of previous devaluations occurring after ATHs that help prove the rule:

**Mid 2011 ATH:** $29.60

**Late 2011 trough:** $2.75 (roughly 10% of $29.60)

**Early 2013 ATH:** $230.00

**Mid 2013 trough:** $66.33 (roughly 20% of $230.00)

**Late 2013 ATH:** about $1k

**Late 2014 trough:** about $250 (roughly 20% of $1k)

**Late 2017 ATH:** about $19k

**Early 2019 trough:** about $3.6k (roughly 20% of $19k)

**Early 2021 ATH:** about $60k

**Late 2022 expected trough:** about $13k-15k (roughly 20% of $60k)

&amp;#x200B;

The first cycle analyzed deviates with a 10% devaluation as Bitcoin was a lot more volatile back in the early 2010s when it was still new-ish.

**NOTE:** we may see a price rebound to a new ATH later this year as there is speculation that we could see a repeat of the 2013 cycle. However, due to Bitcoin's slowing price growth over time, this is not guaranteed!",1625990793,Zeeblackbaron,True,1,12,2021-07-11

&amp;#x200B;

There is a lot of myth around BTC and most of them have been already proven wrong, are just nonsense and some might be true, cause there is no counterargument so far.

I'm a strong believer in bitcoin and all it stands for, don't get me wrong.

BUT, the thing I can't wrap my mind around is, wouldn't BTC create even a much greater inequality if it would become the world currency?

Did some research and as of now, it seems that around 1,000 people are holding 40% BTC. Let's assume, that the other 60% are held by 2% of the world's population. I know, it's probably less, but still...

How could you force the whales to share their wealth with the rest of the world, so everyone would even possess some of it for their daily lives and everything else?

I have some doubts, or maybe misconceptions.

In bitcoin I know that the cost of mining is increasing as you reach the limit of total coins.

I understand that mining is the validation of transactions. Therefore it would be correct to say that assuming an equal number of nodes (equal number of processing power of the entire network), the time per transaction would be increasing day by day.

And if so, then if suddenly many miners would stop mining, bitcoin would collapse, since it would lose a lot of processing power of the network but would still maintain the difficulty making transactions much slower making in practice very difficult to operate with bitcoins.

Bitcoin,7 Reasons why the Bitcoin Lightning Network is Growing,"**#1 Instantaneous Transactions**

Currently, bitcoin blockchain transactions take about an average of 10 minutes to confirm since that is the time every new block gets added to the blockchain by the miners. Depending on the fees, the confirmation time on average can range between 10 mins - 2 hours.

Through Lightning Network the transactions would confirm in a¬†**matter of seconds**¬†making them almost instantaneous.

**#2 Low Fees**

The bitcoin blockchain fees varies according to the market but usually lie in the range of $0.2 ‚Äî $4 to get the transaction confirmed in the next block. This is not always the case, as we saw during the December 2017 price rally where the fees reached as high as $38. As adoption increases so do the load on the blocks and the fees usually go up.

With Lightning Network the¬†[fees](https://1ml.com/statistics) range between 1‚Äì10 satoshi ($0.00008 ‚Äî $0.0008) making them ideal for quick daily transactions.

##### #3 Less congestion on Bitcoin Network

Since the Lightning Network runs on ‚Äòsecond layer‚Äô without interacting with the main bitcoin blockchain, the bitcoin network would remain less congested making it more scalable for adoption.

##### #4 Cross-chain Atomic Swaps

Atomic Swaps links payment channels across different blockchains (cross-chain) allowing users to ‚Äòswap‚Äô their cryptocurrency into another without using third-party custodian services.

Cross-chain atomic swaps can occur in Lightning Network off-chain as long as both chains share the same cryptographic hash function. The transactions are 100% trustless, instant with negligible fees.

**#5 Security First**

The team behind Lightning Network takes security very seriously. There are protocols within the Lightning Network that are deployed to make sure payments are secure and not vulnerable to attacks.

Lighting Network uses Onion Routing to safely route HTLC‚Äôs (Hash-Time-Locked-Contracts, basically a conditional payment) within the network. Similar technology is used by Tor.

**#6 Active Development**

Developments within Lightning Network are very active. New features and upgrades to the software happen regularly and the team is committed to making Lightning Network into a secure, stable solution to scale bitcoin.

**#7 User-friendly Design**

The Lightning Network User Interface is designed to provide a seamless user experience. *Tankred Hase*, lead app developer at lightning, in an official¬†[announcement](https://blog.lightning.engineering/announcement/2019/06/19/mobile-app.html)¬†mentions:

&gt;*We‚Äôve designed the mobile app to be approachable for a wide range of users. That‚Äôs why we began with a clean user interface and a goal to hide complexity and make the app more accessible to new users.*

Lightning Network may sound complicated if you deep-dive into the underlying technology and how it works but to an average user who wants to simply send transactions such information is not really of interest as long as they can send transactions easily and securely.

It's fairly obvious that with the proliferation of Bitcoin and crypto that banks have kicked up the R&amp;D on CBDCs, but some things still leaves me a bit curious.

Will they be based on any of the cryptos we currently use today? Will all currencies be worth the same? I'm aware that the Digital Yuan is already a common place in China through the Wechat app. Are we going to see a system like that? Seems a bit intrusive. And which leads me, will it be on a public or private blockchain? Today you'll be able to cash out your crypto and be given the amount it's worth in fiat and buy crypto with your fiat, but what would be the plan if they deny transactions with this new system?

Us westerners see Bitcoin as a luxury and mostly a store of value now, but it's highly possible that in a few decades we might see our need to switch to Bitcoin as a medium of exchange for goods and services similar to El Salvador, because the way things are heading and some of the decisions being made by a handful of governments (Looking at you UK for that Binance stunt), they'll all potentially become a third world countries if they don't embrace it.

Bitcoin,The 3 Levels of understanding Modern China and overcoming BTC FUD,"**Level 1:** Watch MSM and conclude China is bad.

**Level 2:** Read Kissinger and Mahbubani and conclude China is good.

**Level 3:** Read Anthony Sutton and realize that China today is just another Rockefeller puppet.

The century of humiliation has not ended. The oligarchy moved jobs and technology to China in order to create their template for a society of total control. It is very shameful and un-Chinese to kowtow to western oligarchs! I am quite disappointed.

""The *social experiment* in China under Chairman *Mao's* leadership is one of the most important and successful in human history.‚Äù -David *Rockefeller*

**What this means for BTC:**

Do not believe any China FUD you hear. In fact, do not believe any FUD you hear. It is absolutely meaningless for BTC. Look at the network, look at the protocol. BTC is fundamentally the lifeboat while the oligarchy's fiat ship is sinking.",1625940639,TencentInvestor,True,1,2,2021-07-11

They have done this at least three times since 2013. I think this last one in May will be the last effective one. Not only because people are catching on to the scam, but also because they have now driven out most miners from the country and banned all transactions. This was perfectly timed with Elon's flip-flop. Elon was then immediately awarded by the Chinese government (where he had previously been struggling with red tape and bad press). The only arrow the Chinese Communist Party have left in their quiver is to ban possession, but that would be impossible to enforce, and would only make the CCP appear weak (the thing they fear the most) due to their inability to effectively enforce.

Bitcoin,How would one go about figuring out if a deceased person (my brother) bought bitcoin?,"Hi everyone!

I was wondering if any OG bitcoin folk would know what the most common platform's one might have purchased bitcoin on between the year 2009-2012?

I've recently gotten into cryptocurrency and made my first couple of investments on etoro. It suddenly occurred to me that bitcoin would have been just the kind of thing my brother would have been into. He was an avid redditor and loved new inventions, tech, and futurology in general so I could really see him buying a few bitcoin back in the day to see where it would go.

Here's the problem... My brother passed away very suddenly in 2012 from an undiagnosed heart condition. He was only 24 years old and had just graduated cum laude with a degree in mechanical engineering, 10 days before he died.

I know my parents still have his old MacBook and I recall that we were able to access his password keychain function in the past. I'm pretty sure I can log into his email which would be the first place I would look.

Any tips for keywords, websites, or company names I should look for in this little scavenger hunt? Or general ideas about how one would go about retrieving such information?

 If I wind up finding and gaining access to bitcoin he bought, I'm going to make a sizeable donation to The Heart Foundation, and then split the rest between my parents and siblings.",1625879800,Cool-Pie-7091,True,1,31,2021-07-10

Bitcoin,How to Detect BTC Top and Why Everybody Should be Aware of the Data,"Hey guys,  


I had another thread for TA and Wyckoff and there were many people who think TA or any kind of analysis is BS because crypto market acts different. I strongly disagree. If people are involved, it will act like any market and fluctuate between fear and greed cycles. While professionals take advantage of data and make good decisions, most people will act buy high, sell low because of emotions.   


The more you are in the market and study hard, you start to get an edge over people who buy/sell randomly. 

Let's see how it translate to data.   


[In a previous Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/o5onmt/a_wyckoff_accumulation_here_is_a_little_hopium/), I talked about accumulation structure and called $29k a spring, and so far it seems I was right (no one is right all the time and anything can happen of course). I explained why I think it was accumulation. 

In this post, I'll show how we could detect the top. You can't of course know the exact time to enter or exit, but you can increase your chances even if you are DCAing or buying as you have money. No matter what, you can get cheaper coins with a little research.   


Here it goes  


https://preview.redd.it/jdsk8bsa89a71.png?width=1860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8a4965b5d0812c4f6914950bb4773a70ec886d6

Okay, it may seem complex at first, but it is quite easy. Charts from top to the bottom  


1) BTC Price

2) BTC addresses having 0.1 BTC or more (around $6,000+ at the top)

3) BTC addresses having 1 BTC or more (around $60,000+ at the top)

4) BTC addresses having 10 BTC or more (around $600,000+ at the top)

5) BTC addresses having 100 BTC or more (around $6,000,000+ at the top)

6) BTC addresses having 1,000 BTC or more (around $60,000,000+ at the top)  


\--

Let's see how they react. Number of addresses over 0.1 BTC kept buying while price was going sideways (look at the red boxes). That means retail kept buying. In the meantime, Number of addresses having 1-1,000 BTC, was selling aggressively.   


Look at how addresses over 1,000 BTC increased until very top and how sharply they declined. This started ""BEFORE"" China FUD. So, those whales probably knew what was gonna happen and distributed their coins before the crash while retail kept buying until very end.  


Then look into purple box. Where I think is accumulation. Look how retail dumped in the middle of accumulation (most people considering we'll see $20k (maybe we will, but unlikely)). In the meantime, bigger accounts stopped selling. The biggest BTC addresses started to increase again (it is not very visible in the image as it is streched.)  


Here is a bigger image of balances with over 10 BTC (mid-tier, traders probably). Look how they are accumulating. 

https://preview.redd.it/gmzdd3gy99a71.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e14491a18b49f783095334c984ddfd76577b2be

So, at the top, while price was going sideways, price action was showing a possibility of 2 things: Accumulation or Distribution. It was luck to decide which one was that. However, if you couple it with on-chain analysis, it showed it was more likely that it was distribution because of the buyer's or seller's profile.   


\--

I really love on-chain data with Bitcoin. Think about it, you can literally see where money is flowing. Which address is doing what, how many BTC is moving. It is impossible with the stock market. Banks, institutions, hedge funds move their money without any one of us noticing. They can just dump anytime they feel like and we can't know. However, when money moves in the blockchain, anybody with a $39 Glassnode account (or using free public information with a little creativity) can detect it and take positions.

So, long story short,  


While price was moving sideways at the top: Big addresses sold, small ones bought. That was an indication of a distribution schematic. Now big ones seem to be going sideways/a little up, suggesting an accumulation structure. 

Any structure can be broken and price can go anywhere. But hey, you can use this data to time your buying even if you are a lifetime sat accumulator!

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin can only guarantee 150 million or so transactions on chain per year, which is about how many people are born. How will transaction fees not cost as much as a car if worldwide adoption?","With the bandwidth only able to guarantee 1 or less transactions on chain per person born, it means the average human can only afford 1 if any transaction on average in their whole lifetime. And the rich/corporations would have many more than 1, so the median may even be zero.

Basic supply and demand would mean that this would push transaction fees up sufficiently high that only rich developed world people could afford even a single transaction in their lives, to so much as even open up their own lightning channel once.

So for worldwide adoption, it would be logically necessary to have 2- or 3- or X- deep nested layers of sub-chains, at the regional or even municipal level.

Given that, what would even be the benefit of a blockchain or ""decentralization"" anymore? If I can't afford to make my own channel, even, on the main chain, and thus MUST sign up to my local nested sublayer pool, then I'm not gaining any benefit from any global blockchain, rather I'm stuck in a localized cartel, which can then manipulate things exactly like government did originally with fiat.

Bitcoin,Some advice needed if possible please,"Hey everyone, 

I don‚Äôt have any friends into Bitcoin (as hard as I try) so thought I could ask on here as I enjoy this forum a lot and I‚Äôm a bit torn with what to do.

Long story short, I invested some money into bitcoin and some altcoins last year. I have since been down the rabbit hole (and still going), learnt a huge amount and have decided that I‚Äôm better off with just bitcoin, the actual real money, that works. 

All my altcoin investments are down from the crash but I am wondering if I should cut my losses and convert them all into btc while the btc price is lovely and low. If I wait for this to happen the problem will be Bitcoin will not be as ‚Äòon sale‚Äô as it is now and risk not being able to get as much. 

1. I wait to regain my altcoin losses then sell for btc
2. I sell all altcoins now for btc 
3. I wait for altcoin profit - convert to stablecoin - Then buy btc when it drops again (whenever this maybe... if it‚Äôs not ‚Äòthe last cycle‚Äô)

If I am shorting BTC on Phemex in the BTC USDT pair, any profit is paid in BTC. But I am shorting because I think the asset will fall. 

I ultimately end up with more of the asset BTC with the asset at a lower USDT equivalent value.

Bitcoin,How will BTC handle numerous halvings ?,"Hey guys,

I'd   call myself a bitcoin enthusiast, I love hopium and reading Bitcoin   friendly subreddits but I decided I'll try my best at finding Bitcoin   weaknesses.

So I stumble on a   reddit thread where someone explained that the major weakness of BTC is   that mining BTC will offer diminishing profits as time pass.

If   I understand well each halving events, mined blocks will reward less   and less BTC. If the price increase, it might still be profitable in the   next two halving, but unless BTC price goes to the moon I don't think   as many people will compete for 1,5 BTC only each block (2028\~).

Do   you think the price of one coin could increase so much it could keep   being profitable for as many mining facility as we have nowadays ?

Miners   also benefit from transaction fees, but, BTC seems to be more and more   considered as a store of value due to transaction time and expensive   fees. From my understanding most payements would go through second   layers systems, and miners wouldn't profit from these transactions.

Mining   power being the security of the network, if mining is less and less   profitable, will the BTC slowly collapse until someone manage to run a   51% attack or something ?

Bitcoin,I calculated the carbon emissions related to the Bitcoin network assuming you HODL 1 BTC following Gemini's methodology and the result is scary as hell!," I know that this is an unpopular opinion in this subreddit but as a BTC HOLDer I do care about this so I hope you guys keep an open mind and see that this is indeed an issue and people were right addressing this. I kept my eyes shut while reading the articles but if you do some back of the envelop calculations they are right to raise this as problematic.

 Source : [https://www.gemini.com/blog/introducing-gemini-green-offsetting-bitcoin-carbon-emissions](https://www.gemini.com/blog/introducing-gemini-green-offsetting-bitcoin-carbon-emissions)

*I assume you HODL 1 BTC and I assume you're your own custodian = HODLer.*

following their methodology

* *we  define our ‚Äúusage‚Äù of the Bitcoin Network as the portion of the  mining  process that we benefit from, or rather, the amount of energy  consumed  by miners to secure the bitcoin that Gemini custodies. We  believe that  this custody-based approach more accurately reflects  Gemini‚Äôs usage of  the Bitcoin Network as opposed to a transaction-based  approach, which  ignores the fact that bitcoin at rest are secured by the  mining  process.*
* *As  a result, we calculated the amount of bitcoin  we custody as a  percentage of the circulating supply of bitcoin to  determine our usage  of the Bitcoin Network and then applied this  percentage to the Bitcoin  Network‚Äôs total energy consumption to estimate  the energy consumption  related to our usage. We then offset the energy  consumption related to  our usage that we estimate to involve  non-renewable mining.*

and sources:

* [https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption) (1)
* [https://cbeci.org/](https://cbeci.org/) (2)
* [https://blockchair.com/bitcoin](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin) (3)

From (3) you can see that total # of BTC in circulation right now =  18751865 BTC at the time of writing

Assuming  the values from (1) you can see that "" Annualized carbon footprint of  the Bitcoin Network"" gives 64.18 Mt CO2 ( comparable to the carbon  footprint of **Serbia &amp; Montenegro). M = million = 10\^6**

***Quick calculation:***

**Annualized  carbon footprint of the Bitcoin Network / BTC in circulation = 64.18 Mt  CO2 /  18751865 BTC = 3.41 t CO2 / BTC also written as 3.41 mT CO2 /  BTC (mt = metric tons and not milli ton :))  That's 3.4 tons of CO2 per  year if you HODL BTC**

***LONG calculation:***

**Step 1**: Calculate usage of the Bitcoin Network assuming you HODL 1 BTC

* ¬†¬†Your bitcoin balance / Average daily bitcoin in circulation (3)  = your usage of the Bitcoin Network

1 BTC / 18751865 BTC =  0.000000053328

**Step 2**: Calculate the energy consumed by miners related to your‚Äôs usage of the Bitcoin Network/year

* your  usage of the Bitcoin Network x the Bitcoin Network‚Äôs average¬†annualized  energy consumption (2) = energy consumed by miners related to your  usage of the Bitcoin Network

0.000000053328 \*  **67.2 TWh** =   0.00000358364 **TWh**

**Step 3**:  Calculate the carbon intensity of the energy  used by the Bitcoin  Network. ‚ÄúCarbon intensity‚Äù is defined as the  amount of carbon emitted  per unit of energy consumed.

* Annualized  carbon footprint of the Bitcoin Network (1) / Projected annual energy  usage of Bitcoin network = carbon intensity of the energy used by¬†the  Bitcoin Network (1)

**64.18 Mt CO2** /  **135.12 TWh** =  474985.1 **t CO2 / TWh (t = tons) or** 474985.1 **mt CO2 / TWh (metric tons)**

**Step 4**: Calculate the carbon emissions related to your usage of the Bitcoin Network.

* ¬†(Energy  consumed by miners related to your usage of the Bitcoin¬†Network x  carbon intensity of the Bitcoin Network) per year = ¬†Carbon emissions  related to your usage of the Bitcoin Network

0.00000358364 **TWh** \* 474985.1 **t CO2 / TWh per year =**  !!!! **1.70** **t CO2 per year !!!!!**

**Step 5**: Calculate the cost to offset the carbon emissions related to your usage of the Bitcoin Network.

* ¬†Carbon  emissions related to your usage of the Bitcoin Network x cost ¬†per  permit to emit 1 mT CO2 = cost to offset the carbon emissions related to  your usage of the Bitcoin Network

**1.70** **t CO2 \***  $11.79 per permit / 1 t CO2 = 20$ !

Google search gives me this: "" **The  average carbon footprint for a person  in the United States is 16 tons,  one of the highest rates in the world.  Globally, the average is closer  to 4 tons.** To have the best chance of  avoiding a 2‚ÑÉ rise in global temperatures, the average global **carbon footprint per** year needs to drop under 2 tons by 2050.""

Tl;DR:  Hodling 1 BTC and using Bitcoin network and its PoW is kinda bad for  the planet and as a bitcoin HODLER I'm pretty shocked by this knowing  that the global average carbon footprint (per year) is approx. 4 tons of  CO2 / person / year...

The renewable (mostly hydro) used for mining would go into the grid anyways, so, even by using renewable energy bitcoin mining is increasing the total energy consumption globally. But something like these heaters is when bitcoin mining has no extra energy consumption, THAT is the powerful answer to Musk et al

The idea is definitely not new, I‚Äôve seen quite a few people doing the same DYI style. But DYI is for the active&amp;techy few, don‚Äôt think it can be a mass movement. Having an easy to use device that my grandma (and grandpa) would use could actually gain enough volume to make bitcoin mining properly eco-friendly, consuming **NO EXTRA ENERGY &lt;== THAT‚ÄôS the goal we should target.**

I liked the idea and even posted their video here before (can find it easily), clearly the more hardcore members of our community would prefer a bare bones S9 or whatever other miner but I‚Äôm just thinking how cool it would be to take the mining away from the large farms and make it a mass movement with grandmas&amp;grandpas participating.

You can see I‚Äôm very excited by the idea, even thinking of investing in their current round. Filled in the info on their website, fingers crossed they‚Äôll approve me. 

Right now I‚Äôm not yet sure about two things:

1 Will there be enough to heat in the Southern Hemisphere during Northern Hemisphere summer? If not, the large mining farms will still need to exist, just have more competition in winter

2 This is a new device and maybe not all the specs will be as described. But finger crossed... this will definitely be good for bitcoin

Bitcoin,Which Countries have banned Bitcoin so far?," First, there are those who are excited about the [potential for blockchain](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/10/26/4-reasons-bitcoin-could-hit-10000-and-why-its-stil.aspx), the digital and decentralized ledger that logs virtual currency transactions in a secure and efficient manner without the need for a financial intermediary like a bank. Enterprise customers are showing plenty of interest in blockchain, and since nearly all are open-source networks, it would make altering logged data practically impossible. That makes blockchain particularly secure. 

 Finally, we can't argue against the role emotions have played in sending cryptocurrencies higher. The fear of missing out on big gains has perpetuated consistently strong buying in bitcoin and other digital currencies. 

 However, bitcoin's ascent hasn't been without some notable speed bumps. Because it's not backed by a central bank or government, it's frowned upon in certain countries. For instance, earlier this year China outlawed initial coin offerings, which often involve exchanging bitcoin for newly issued virtual currency. The economic giant also announced the closure of domestic cryptocurrency exchanges. While it hasn't outlawed bitcoin, China has made trading or owning bitcoin a real challenge for its citizens -- and bitcoin is banned for banking institutions. 

 

Some countries that have entirely banned bitcoin:

1. **Bolivia:** Back in June 2014, the Bolivian central bank officially banned any currency or coins that aren't regulated by the government. Included in its list of examples was bitcoin. Bolivia's central bank also prohibited its citizens from denominating prices in any currency tha its national institutions haven't previously approved.
2. **Ecuador:** Not long after Bolivia's central bank banned bitcoin, Ecuador also removed its welcome mat in July 2014. The country's National Assembly of Ecuador banned bitcoin and other digital currencies while laying the framework for the creation of a new, state-run currency. In other words, the government has the permission to make payments in electronic money, but other digital currencies, like bitcoin, are banned for its citizens.
3. **Kyrgyzstan:** In July 2014, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic made it crystal clear that using bitcoin, or any digital currency, as a form of payment is illegal. The only legal tender in Kyrgyzstan is the som, the country's national currency. The Kyrgyz National Bank cited that bitcoin's lack of governmental backing makes public or private regulation almost impossible.¬†
4. **Bangladesh:** Bangladesh also followed suit in September 2014. The Bangladeshi central bank cited bitcoin's lack of a central payment system as the reason behind the ban, which it believes would allow people to be ""financially harmed."" Long story short -- if you're caught trading in bitcoin in Bangladesh, it could lead to legal trouble under the Foreign Currency Control Act of 1947 and the Money Laundering Control Act of 2012.
5. **Nepal:** Though it might not be a well-known fact throughout the country, bitcoin is illegal in Nepal, according to Kedar Prasad Acharya, the deputy director of Nepal Rastra Bank. The Nepalese government banned bitcoin on account of not being able to track its transactions, and it has gone so far as to arrest individuals suspected of trading bitcoin.
6. **Morocco:** The newest ban, coming as of November 2017, was in Morocco, which ironically came just days after domestic digital services provider MTDS announced that it would accept bitcoin as payment for the first time. Like the other countries before it, Morocco's central bank cited ""a hidden payment system that is not backed by any financial institution"" as its reasoning for banning bitcoin and other digital currencies.

A cryptocurrency, or crypto, is a digital currency that can be used to buy goods and services, but is secured but uses an online ledger with strong cryptography that makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. The most popular form of cryptocurrency is Bitcoin.

3. can you decipher the columns in this chart(attached link below) please(chart is from binance)  
I know the **Leverage** column and I also know **Initial Margin Rate** column means your position can't go below that percentage of your money value otherwise your position will be liquefied, but I don't know what the **position column(Notional Value)** is talking about.., is that the eligibility meaning you need to have at least $200m to do 2x leverages?

I did manage to get the token file to work but it still keeps crashing (in python it reads killed23456) and I know I'm close to getting the desired results. At first I used Windows 10 but it didn't play well and crashed multiple times.

&amp;#x200B;

I am kind of new to the finance/economics side of things here. I understand the basic model of profit/loss and cost of production with respect to units sold from a company's operating POV.

I watched the his argument on Why Gold/Commodity is awful from the 26:00 mark to 30:37 mark.

I have few questions specifically on what Saylor talks about in the above segment (would appreciate if anyone would care to shine a light and educate on the following points) -

1. Why are commodities awful?
2. (27:14) Why do the commodities producer keep pumping commodities even if they are losing money? \[is it because they hope the price would go up or the variable cost would go down ONE day?\]
3. (27:52) Can't transmute $ X bn gold mining capital to something else. \[can't they sell it off to recover atleast the fixed cost?\]
4. (28:28) The producers overproduce the commodity. (28:45) the real risk of gold (29:22) variable cost equals price \[how can one produce at below variable cost?\]
5. (29:36) Government will produce below variable cost to maintain jobs \[how can one produce below variable cost, and how it helps it maintaining jobs?\]

I basically want to understand his argument on why Gold/Commodities are awful based on what he is saying here.",1625793334,Accurate-View-2114,True,1,10,2021-07-09

THEY DON'T. All they want is more (your) money.Celsius created hodl mode for clients that want a ""security"" so a hacker can't withdraw everything instant and will need at least 24 hours to deactivate it and 24 more to change withdraw address.Once again all of these measures aren't for your protection but for them to keep your money longer (as banks do).So the hodl mode wasn't created to help celsius clients but for the sole purpose of blocking clients funds at their will (with or without their consent).

Freezing account COULD be ok for legal reason not for personal reason of a staff member.

\*\*So what happened exactly?\*\*Withdraws on celsius are free and seems to be unlimited. So I wondered if there was a limit, even a big limit to avoid spam and what's celsius policy about lot of withdraws.So before doing anything I asked on the telegram group these questions politely.An admin nicked ""Xineohp"" answered me ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt abuse the system‚Äù several times pretty aggressively. I said it wasn't multiple times too but he didn't seem to understand and told me to contact support.So I proposed to contact support to ask them directly and maybe show a potential flaw so they can patch it.So in view of the aggressiveness I decided to not do any batch withdraw and just make a single withdraw. Just withdraw MY funds peacefully.

*few minutes later*Before take my phone in my hand I got a notification from celsius app ""We activated HODL mode on your behalf"" and my mom got the SAME.So the guy seems to have search for me in clients files based on my telegram username AND ip to link to my mother (which live in same home) to completely freeze us.

Asking questions politely is not a reason to block ME and all my family members. Even worse as anybody could use your nickname on telegram, so anybody could say anything using your name and your money get frozen. So that could be someone else than me!

When I said ""Celsius team forced all mode on my wallet"" I got muted from the group by the same admin ""to avoid FUD spread"". FACTS are here.

I did a thread on twitter that was ignored by influencers I tagged which prefer share their referrals and make money than warn their community. I also tagged CEO which is active on twitter (maybe he isn't aware of these internal practises?) but he played blind too.I tagged cointelegraph writers and proposed to tell them more about al lof this but I wasn't contacted. Probably the same reason again, not financially interesting. If I'm not wrong they are paid to write about companies, why would they write a free article warning ppl?I contacted the admin the again which doesn't denyed anything but just answered

`I do not want FUD in the chat. Celsius placed you in HODL mode because of your actions.`

`I'm no longer going to communicate with you. Please communicate directly with Celsius via support email at` [`app@celsius.network`](mailto:app@celsius.network)`.`Then I contacted another admin of that group and described all of this and after insistance I got that answer:

`I have just heard back from support and they said they will be in contact with you about your account`then no way to get any response from him either and of course refuse to unmute me too.

The so called support doesn't answer since more than 72 hours now and I have serious doubt getting answer anytime soon, telegram muted and telegram group admins refusing to answer anymore.Celsius often give welcome bonus to get more clients, they once proposed to do review on App Store/Play Store/TrustPilot in exchanges of bonus (20$ crypto if I remember well).

Cryptocurrencies have a bad reputation because it's often related to scam, rug pull, ponzi schemes AND exit scams.My family members don't want to hear about crypto anymore after about -50% and now plateform blocking us just because a staff member doesn't like me.From my side I hope to get our accounts unfrozen asap so if I still have that right I'll withdraw everything and uninstall the app forever if not I will sue them. My family members will market sell asap because as I said they're now disgusted of crypto.

For current and potential futures clients of Celsius you are free to listen that warning, you can't get a worse red flag than this. I you absolutely want a lender I may redirect you to [Nexo](https://nexo.io/).You should think twice before depositing anything on Celsius.My DM are open for any journalist that would like more infos about this.

Bitcoin,Visa says crypto-linked card usage tops $1 billion in first half of 2021,"Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu told CNBC, ‚ÄúWe are doing a lot to create an ecosystem that makes cryptocurrency more usable and more like any other currency.‚Äù
The company is currently partnered with Coinbase, Circle and BlockFi to allow its cards to access crypto wallets on those platforms.
Visa said digital payments such as cryptocurrency have the potential to disrupt $18 trillion of annual consumer spending with cash and checks.
Visa said Wednesday that more than $1 billion worth of cryptocurrency was spent by consumers globally on goods and services through their crypto-linked cards in the first six months of the year.

By comparison, Visa estimated crypto spending at only a fraction of that amount in the same periods last year and in 2019. The payments giant did not release exact numbers.

‚ÄúWe are doing a lot to create an ecosystem that makes crypto currency more usable and more like any other currency,‚Äù Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu told CNBC. ‚ÄúPeople are exploring ways in which they can use cryptocurrencies for things they would use normal currencies for.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúThere are lots of issues in terms of volatility, etc. But that‚Äôs up to the owners of cryptocurrencies to manage and track.‚Äù
According to recent research from Visa rival Mastercard, 93% of North American consumers plan to use cryptocurrency or other emerging payment technology, such as biometrics, contactless, or QR code systems, in the next year. The study also showed that 75% of millennials would use crypto currency if they understood it better.

‚ÄúWe see a lot of volume on our [network] of people buying crypto currencies at these various regulated exchanges and as far as we can see that trend continues,‚Äù Prabhu said.
This summer, Mastercard will launch a card with crypto exchange Gemini, co-founded by billionaires Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. The card will allow consumers to earn cryptocurrency as a reward. However, cardholders will not be allowed to access their digital wallet on the site.

Visa also announced Wednesday the FTX cryptocurrency platform, founded by billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, would be added to its Fintech Fast Track Program, focused in part on making cryptocurrency more practical for consumer and business spending.
Circle, BlockFi and Coinbase, which went public in April on the Nasdaq, are current Visa partners that allow cardholders to spend from their cryptocurrency wallet at more than 70 million merchants globally. Visa estimated crypto-linked cards and other emerging payments including biometrics and QR code have the potential to disrupt the $18 trillion spent every year with cash and checks globally.

Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap topped $1 trillion for the fist time in February and hit an all-time high near $65,000 per unit in April due to retail investor enthusiasm during the coronavirus pandemic as a store of value and an inflation hedge. However, bitcoin has fallen roughly 45% since then ‚Äî and last month, it plunged briefly below $29,000 where it started the year.
Prahbu said Visa has no near-term plans to add any cryptocurrency to its balance sheet like Tesla, MicroStrategy and other companies have done recently.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt hold crypto currencies on our balance sheet today. We hold currencies on our balance sheet that we need to run our business. We hold currencies that we get paid in or we pay people in. That tends to be the dollar, euro, pound. So we don‚Äôt have plans to hold crypto currency because it‚Äôs not typically the way we get paid or the way we pay people,‚Äù he said.",1625775390,ratenasty,True,1,1,2021-07-09

Bitcoin,Britain‚Äôs crackdown on Binance boosts the cryptocurrency exchange‚Äôs rivals,"The U.K.‚Äôs Financial Conduct Authority recently moved to block Binance, the world‚Äôs top crypto exchange, from operating in the country.
While Binance can continue offering crypto trading services to Brits, it was ordered to notify users that it is not authorized to operate in the U.K.
The FCA‚Äôs crackdown on Binance has benefited a number of its rivals, including Bitstamp, Kraken and Gemini.
LONDON ‚Äî Britain‚Äôs move to block Binance is boosting rival cryptocurrency exchanges, which have reported a surge in new users in the country recently.

The Financial Conduct Authority recently announced a crackdown on Binance, the world‚Äôs top crypto exchange by trading volume, restricting the company from carrying out regulated activities in the U.K.

Binance withdrew its application to register as a licensed crypto asset firm in the U.K. in May due to not meeting anti-money laundering requirements, the markets watchdog said.
While Binance is technically allowed to continue offering crypto trading to Brits, it was ordered by regulators to add a notice to its website saying it is not authorized to operate in the U.K.

For its part, Binance said the measures only targeted its U.K. entity, Binance Markets Limited, and would have no impact on services provided in the country by Binance.com.

But following the FCA‚Äôs restrictions, Binance has suffered subsequent setbacks in Britain. Customers were temporarily unable to make card withdrawals due to an issue with the U.K.‚Äôs Faster Payments system. Meanwhile, the bank Barclays has blocked customers from sending payments to the crypto exchange.
Binance‚Äôs woes in the U.K. have been a boon to its rivals, though, some of which have seen user numbers double since the FCA restrictions were announced.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing an increase in customers in the U.K. coming to us, with no changes in marketing,‚Äù Julian Sawyer, CEO of Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp, told CNBC.

As of Tuesday, Bitstamp had seen its customers grow 138% since the FCA issued its notice about Binance on June 25. Binance declined to comment on this story when contacted by CNBC.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a flight to safety,‚Äù Sawyer added. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre told that the bank you‚Äôre with is less secure, you move the money out of the bank and move it into the next bank which is super secure.‚Äù
Meanwhile, U.S.-based exchange Kraken has also benefited.

‚ÄúThe percentage share of signups from the U.K. has approximately doubled in the last couple of weeks, compared to signups in Kraken‚Äôs other leading markets,‚Äù a Kraken spokesperson told CNBC.

Gemini, the digital currency exchange started by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is one of the few companies listed on the FCA‚Äôs list of registered crypto asset firms.
‚ÄúWe have seen tremendous user growth as consumers look towards approved firms when entering the market,‚Äù Blair Halliday, Gemini‚Äôs head of U.K., told CNBC.
‚ÄúWe expect to see exchanges and custodians registered with the FCA continue to gain market share due to the value placed on the approval process,‚Äù he added.

Coinbase, America‚Äôs largest crypto exchange, declined to comment on this story.Crypto crackdown
Binance‚Äôs woes haven‚Äôt been limited to the U.K.

On Tuesday, Binance said it had temporarily suspended euro bank deposits through the Single Euro Payments Area payments scheme, due to ‚Äúevents beyond our control.‚Äù

And regulators in Canada, Japan and Thailand have also issued warnings to the company about it operating without authorization.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, better known in the industry as ‚ÄúCZ,‚Äù said in a blog post Wednesday the exchange ‚Äústill has a lot of room to grow‚Äù and that it hasn‚Äôt always gotten things right.
‚ÄúCompliance is a journey ‚Äì especially in new sectors like crypto,‚Äù Zhao said, adding Binance is hiring more compliance staff and localizing operations to better meet its regulatory obligations.

It follows a number of steps taken by regulators in China to clamp down on the crypto industry. Several regions in the country have moved to stamp out energy-intensive crypto mining operations, amid concerns over their environmental impact.
Earlier this week, Beijing called for the shutdown of a company suspected of providing software for virtual currency transactions, reiterating its tough stance on crypto.

Digital currencies rallied at the start to the year, with bitcoin jumping to an all-time high of almost $65,000 in April. But they‚Äôve since fallen sharply, with the overall crypto market losing more than $1 trillion in value in the last two months.",1625772036,pumicersyringasn3,True,1,0,2021-07-09

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin, ether tumble as investors take off risk amid global markets slide","The price of bitcoin dropped Thursday as investors began shedding risk amid an equity markets decline. Fears of a slowing global economic comeback caused by the potential spread of the Covid-19 delta variant appeared to be behind investors move into safer assets like Treasurys.

Bitcoin is trading at $32,800, down about 5% on the day according to Coin Metrics. Most other cryptocurrency assets are falling with it, including ether, which is trading about 9% lower at $2,140.

That backslide came around the time of reports Japan has declared a state of emergency in Tokyo for the upcoming Olympics based on a potential rebound in Covid-19 cases. Stock futures fell on the news, and companies that would benefit from an economic rebound declined in early trading. The 10-year Treasury yield also dropped to 1.25%.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., warned against the growing risks the ‚Äúhighly opaque and volatile‚Äù cryptocurrency market poses to consumers and financial markets in a letter to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler.

Bitcoin has struggled to reclaim its May highs. Its price has been hovering in the $30,000 range, down from its all-time high of $65,000 it reached in April. Some traders see bitcoin going higher in the long-term despite some near-term headwinds. Still, some say it could fall as low at $20,000 before institutional investors get back into it.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre consolidating in here between [$30,000 and $35,000]. What we‚Äôre seeing is Asia sells it off, and then the U.S. buys it back,‚Äù Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said Thursday on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù ‚ÄúChina has declared war on crypto as part of this broader cold war that we‚Äôre getting into, and so I think we‚Äôre still digesting that.‚Äù

On Tuesday, China‚Äôs central bank called for another shutdown of a company that ‚Äúwas suspected of providing software services for virtual currency transactions.‚Äù For years, China has regularly issued bans on the cryptocurrency industry and operations.
While bitcoin has sometimes been referred to as a hedge, the reality is it‚Äôs been quite volatile this year and tends to decrease amid broader declines in risk assets.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of ownership correlated with other assets, right? So if you‚Äôre a hedge fund and you‚Äôre getting whacked in your rate position and your equity position and your oil position, you‚Äôre probably going to sell some of your crypto as well ,‚Äù said Novogratz, a longtime crypto investor. ‚ÄúIt just takes a while for it to build a more diverse investor base.‚Äù",1625771732,obviatorscolp42,True,1,4,2021-07-09

Bitcoin,MARKETS Digital currency company Circle to go public via SPAC at $4.5 billion valuation,"Circle plans to go public by the end of the year through a SPAC with Concord Acquisition Corp.
The announcement comes as regulators seek more clarity around the trading and issuers of stablecoins ‚Äî digital currency that‚Äôs designed to be less volatile than other crypto ‚Äî with one proposal suggesting they obtain bank charters.
Payments and digital currency firm Circle plans to go public later this year through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Concord Acquisition Corp.

The deal, which Circle announced on Thursday, is expected to close in the fourth quarter and would value the company at $4.5 billion.

‚ÄúWe just see an incredible opportunity to grow rapidly and grow around the world, and we think that this set of transactions and becoming a public company really sets us up to be a trusted platform in this in this digital currency industry,‚Äù Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box‚Äù Thursday morning.

The eight-year-old startup is best known for co-creating the U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin USD Coin, or USDC.
Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to be less volatile than cryptocurrencies by pegging their market value to an outside asset like the U.S. dollar. Tether is one of the best known and most controversial ones, along with USDC and the initially Facebook-led Diem (formerly known as Libra). There are currently $26 billion of USDC in circulation, Allaire told ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù
The announcement of Circle‚Äôs deal comes amid growing concern by regulators that there should be more transparency in the trading of stablecoins, the reserves backing them and the overreliance on them to enable trading in decentralized finance or DeFi. 

In December, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., along with Reps. Jesus Garcia, D-Ill., and Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., introduced Stablecoin Tethering and Bank Licensing Enforcement Act, or the STABLE Act.

The legislation would require issuers to obtain bank charters and keep reserve funds equal in amount to the number of stablecoins they issue, with the Federal Reserve.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen growing adoption and usage of the USDC across an ever-widening range of use cases,‚Äù Jeremy Fox-Geen, Circle‚Äôs chief financial officer, according to a transcript of an investor conference call filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday.

‚ÄúWhile we believe that the use case for USDC is the same as the use case for a dollar, for many of those use cases, USDC is the better product,‚Äù Fox-Geen said, because it can move and settle faster and more cheaply.
Payment systems adoption
‚ÄúWe operate this market infrastructure of USDC which doesn‚Äôt have a clear comparable,‚Äù Allaire said on ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fundamental innovation in payment systems, so you might think about large payment technology companies,‚Äù like Visa or Mastercard.

Earlier this year, Visa settled a USDC transaction on its payment network. The move lays the groundwork to potentially support a digital dollar and other central bank digital currencies worldwide. 

‚ÄúOn the other hand, we‚Äôre building this suite of what we call transaction and treasury services ‚Äì those look more similar to at-scale, financial services platforms. It‚Äôs a diversified set of businesses,‚Äù Allaire added.
Circle also provides other commerce and financial applications for businesses. Allaire said on the same investor conference call that customers are ‚Äúhighly global,‚Äù with more than 50% outside the U.S., and that the company is investing aggressively to expand its international digital currency payments and treasury services operations.

Allaire, who is also the company‚Äôs co-founder, will remain CEO of the company. Bob Diamond, chairman of Concord Acquisition Corp. and CEO of Atlas Merchant Capital, will join the board.",1625771289,legionaryexes61,True,1,0,2021-07-09

The current year's 500% aggregated addition took Ether's (ETH) cost to a $4,380 untouched high on May 12, and this convention was considerably more hearty than the late-2017 move.

The renowned positively trending business sector, or air pocket, contingent upon how you see it, took Ether's cost on a 390% convention from $290 in November 2017 to $1,420 in mid-January 2018.¬†

Possibly the current year's super meeting was a DeFi and NFT bubble that will require an additional two years to recover its pinnacle, yet it appears to be untimely to make an expectation now.

Notwithstanding, a few experts, including Celsius Network CEO Alex Mashinsky, contend that Ether's ""flippening"" has effectively happened when contrasting the broadness of resources under administration.¬†

As indicated by Mashinsky, Ether's essential use case is yield cultivating, the act of marking or securing up crypto return for remunerations, while Bitcoin is for the most part utilized as a store of significant worth.¬†

The assumption for expanded scaling is another explanation that drives Ether financial backers to stay bullish in spite of the current cost being 47% beneath its untouched high.¬†

Moreover, on July 1, worldwide inspecting monster Ernst and Young delivered the third cycle of its zero-information evidence Ethereum scaling arrangement called Nightfall 3.¬†

Nightfall 3 uses zk-Rollups, a layer-two adaptability brilliant agreement comprising of bunched moves ""rolled"" into one exchange, to further develop exchange proficiency and protection on the Ethereum organization.

As indicated by the examination, it will probably bring about a 90% decrease in gas charges.

The latest change diminished the trouble to a level last found in June 2020, when the computerized money exchanged at $9,000 per coin.¬†  


Mining is multiple times more productive than last year. Inferring that for a similar measure of work this time last year, a Bitcoin excavator who wins a square award would today get BTC worth multiple occasions what they were worth by then.

Subsequently, there is an unbelievable choice of digital forms of money, whose organizers have high any expectations of expanding in esteem.   


Purposes behind putting resources into cryptographic forms of money have gone from images to factions of character.

My most genuine counsel is to really utilize the stuff. Purchase somewhat of a couple of various coins, then, at that point attempt to do with them what it's promoted that they should do. 

Simply doing this is a genuine stunner, and you catch on actually quickly which projects really work and which don't.

Bitcoin,"The Bitcoin Rich will buy out almost every major company &amp; politician against Bitcoin &amp; force them to integrate Bitcoin, just as the last internet rich people bought out &amp; forced most every smart phone, computer, &amp; website to integrate Facebook &amp; Google into them","The big realization with Bitcoin is that it is where most of the money has gone in the last 12 years, making the richest class of people in the world all supporting one thing: Bitcoin 

Those rich assholes are going to buy out every company against bitcoin, every politician against it, &amp; make all things in the world integrate bitcoin, just like like the last rich assholes before them made the world integrate Facebook &amp; Google into every smart phone. There‚Äôs no stopping it at this point. 

Someone builds a quantum computer to try &amp; hack Bitcoin? Those rich assholes will already have a thousand quantum computers protecting the bitcoin network by then; just like Jeff Bezos, or any other billionaire does today, those rich assholes will buy out their enemies. 

Ever wonder why Visa card, PayPal, JP morgan chase, Goldman Sachs, etc, are now all pro bitcoin after being so negative about it only a few years ago? It‚Äôs because the rich assholes in Bitcoin already bought out a majority share of Their companies stocks &amp; forced them to integrate it. 

They‚Äôre buying up all the shares of the money companies first, anyone paying attention can see it. 

Everything else will be easy to buy majority share control over after owning the financial transmission companies. 

One day, those rich assholes will likely own a majority share of Google, Amazon, every major bank, and every major company in the world. And idk if you guys know how the federal reserve works, but it‚Äôs shares are owned by every major bank in the world, so once Bitcoin rich assholes own a majority share of every major bank as they‚Äôre buying up now, then they will eventually literally own the federal reserve. 

But the moral of the story is that it‚Äôs too late to stop this train. You can either join the rich assholes &amp; hop onto the internet 2.0 of financial energy storage &amp; transmission, or you can be left behind, just like all the Ma and Pa shops that were left behind and destroyed by the rich assholes of the last internet 1.0 of data information storage and transmission. 
Ma and Pa shops who they choked out by using the internet to take their customers, and then bought out for pennies on the dollar after their websites choked them out financially and left them in debt and ruin, just like crypto exchanges have been choking out the banks and investment firms for the last 12 years by attracting their customers to Bitcoin exchanges just as the first internet did with Ma and Pa shop‚Äôs customers.

Bitcoin,The right perspective in Bitcoin,"Hi guys. I have question. I lost a significant amount in Bitcoin in leverage trading. I got back what I lost after my altcoins pumped and taded to Bitcoin.

The question is this.

If this was you. Would you still consider it a loss or getting even? I mean i lost too much BTC in leverage trading and all in all i handled
it well but I sometimes can‚Äôt stop forgetting the big loss and. Im trying to have the right perspective.

I stoped leverage trading 6 months ago and will never do it again. 

What i learned about my loss.

Leverage trading is gambling for 90% of the people if not more.

You can win 9 times in a row but lose everything the tenth time.

Bitcoin is real and it‚Äôs value going up is not a question about if but when.

90% or more altcoins are only for the creators to get more Bitcoin or fiat.

I  underestimated how much whales and smart money can manipulate the Bitcoin price. To what degree can they manipulate the price and what is the point in investing if they can manipulate
this much?

I told my friends to get in when Bitcoin was under 10K or DCA to be in a position of strength so to not panic when the price goes down. Most didn‚Äôt listen and got in much later and they are now considering selling at loss.

I try to make my friends understand this things i mentioned but they won‚Äôt listen.

Bitcoin,Andreessen Horowitz is planing to invest Billions in cryptomarket,"Sorry, my lazy ass just used a famous website to translate this article, but my english isn't any better you guys.

You may tend to refuse to see this as positive, but the more big players are in, the more stable BTC price becomes. If there's just hodlers and a few whales, whales can do whatever they want. Also there's no more FUD about ""cracking down"" anything, because who is messing with big money (except reddit stonks of course lol).  


&gt; **Investments in crypto assets**    
&gt;  
&gt;The venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz invested in companies such as Airbnb, Facebook and Instagram at an early stage and was thus able to gain a high reputation in the venture capital market. Today the venture capital firm is one of the most prominent in Silicon Valley. The venture capitalist Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, has also been investing in crypto startups since 2013: including in the first place in Coinbase, but also in Uniswap, Dapper Labs, Protocol Labs, Solana Labs and Facebook's stablecoin project Diem.   
&gt;  
&gt; **Great success with the Coinbase IPO**   
&gt;  
&gt; In April 2021 Andreessen Horowitz made good money on the IPO of the Coinbase company. Even before the IPO, investor Marc Andreessen owned shares in Coinbase. Andreessen Horowitz itself also held 24.6 percent of Class A shares and 14.2 percent of Class B shares right from the start. This made them the largest institutional investor in the crypto exchange. The venture capitalist entered with $ 25 million and a company valuation of $ 140 million. When the company went public, the stake was worth around $ 11.2 billion on an initial price basis.    
&gt;  
&gt;**Crypto Fund III**    
&gt;  
&gt;Now the venture capital firm wants to continue investing in crypto assets. The third crypto fund that the company is launching is totaling 2.2 billion US dollars. According to ""Trending Topics"", this makes it the largest crypto fund that has ever been launched. For comparison: Andreessen Horowitz's Crypto Fund I was worth $ 300 million, and the Crypto Fund II was $ 515 million. According to the company, top-class employees from a wide variety of areas have also been hired to support the venture capitalist with the challenges in the crypto sector. Last year, for example, Anthony Albanese, who previously worked at the New York Stock Exchange, was hired to manage investments. The company website also states that Andreessen Horowitz is more excited than ever to see how and where the crypto industry will develop: ""We have never been so excited about where crypto is going and we are relying everything on the talented, visionary founders who determined to be part of the next chapter on crypto. If you are one of them we would love to hear from you ‚Äù. Judging from this, Andreessen Horowitz will probably make further crypto investments in the future. The venture capitalist is optimistic about the potential of cryptocurrencies. According to the company's website, it is planned to continue investing in crypto networks and the founders and teams who work in this area.",1625748447,ismirschlecht,True,1,14,2021-07-08

Bitcoin,U.S. Senator warns of BTC risks and pressures SEC to strengthen supervision,"U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren warned on Thursday that the ‚Äúhighly opaque and volatile‚Äù BTC market poses increasing risks to consumers and financial markets, and criticized its lack of supervision as unsustainable. She also expressed her concerns in a letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler on Wednesday. Warren stated that she needs to get Gensler's response to the SEC's power to protect consumer investment and trading BTC before July 28, and to determine what actions Congress needs to take in the future. Warren said in a statement: ""Although the demand for BTC and cryptocurrency exchanges has soared, the lack of common sense regulations has left ordinary investors at the mercy of manipulators and fraudsters. These regulatory loopholes endanger consumers. And investors, and undermine the security of our financial markets. The SEC must make full use of its power to deal with these risks, and Congress must step up to close these regulatory loopholes.""",1625747996,Vairlee,True,1,157,2021-07-08

Bitcoin,Which exchange is the best for fast wire transfers?,"Hi.

I'm considering starting to trade and for that I would like to make wire transfers.  I have used ACH in the past with Coinbase Pro and while it shows up in the account immediately, it takes a week to allow me to withdraw my bitcoin after I purchase.  For what I would like to do, that sounds kind of slow.  I'm a little worried about Coinbase wire transfers also being slow which of course destroys the point of a wire transfer.  However, nobody else sounds any better.

Unfortunately, I cannot use Binance so I'd like to hear about other quality exchanges that will allow me to efficiently (within a few hours) wire in fiat cash.

When you send a response, please write that you have used the exchange, you have withdrawn bitcoin, you have wired them fiat money, the exchange received it and how fast the exchange credited your account.  If you did not do all of this then you are just guessing and wasting everyone's time.

Thanks and happy hodling.",1625739982,extrastone,True,1,3,2021-07-08

First, the negative vocabulary of virtual currency is no longer used, but it is defined as a private digital currency (a typical representative of a private digital currency is currencies such as Bitcoin, including various so-called ""stable coins"" launched). A new formulation is more in line with international standards. But there is also a vague definition of whether it is an asset or a currency. For example, Zhou Xiaochuan recently called it an encrypted asset.

The response emphasized that ""for these private digital currencies, whether they exist as monetary credit or not, we are still observing and studying"", showing a relatively open attitude. Prior to this, Li Bo, deputy governor of the Central Bank (now transferred to the IMF), expressed similar views, saying, ‚ÄúIf it is used as an investment tool, many countries, including China, are also studying how such an investment method should be. A kind of regulatory environment"".

In addition, more information about relatively strong supervision has been released.

Second, respond to the issue of digital currency can be divided into private digital currency and central bank digital currency, to oppose the two, and to emphasize the follow-up promotion of central bank digital currency with more space. In the case of confrontation, the negative and the impact are even stronger.

Third, the response stated that these currencies themselves have become a speculative tool. This situation has occurred in the market, and there are also potential risks that threaten financial security and social stability. At the same time, it has also become a payment tool for some money laundering and illegal economic activities. The so-called ""stable coins"" of some commercial organizations, especially the global ""stable coins"", may bring risks and challenges to the international monetary system, payment and settlement system, etc. We are still quite worried about this issue, so we adopt Some measures have been taken.

Private digital currency is classified as a ""speculative tool"". Although this is a neutral term, it must be negative in the current policy context. This is also similar to the expression of the former central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan. Zhou Xiaochuan said, ‚ÄúWhen it comes to the innovation of cryptocurrency, China‚Äôs attitude is also to focus on how you serve the real economy in many analyses and discussions. To provide important services to the real economy, then more attention may be given.""

Fourth, this response emphasized stablecoins. Previously, only Bitcoin was mentioned in the Financial Committee meeting. In fact, compared to Bitcoin, stablecoins anchored to the US dollar have more applications in illegal activities such as speculation, payment and even money laundering and gambling. But on the other hand, it seems that the conventional practices have been exhausted, except for the prohibition of institutional participation, public opinion crackdowns, and crackdowns on electronic fraud and money laundering. Whether there will be more stringent measures, such as new regulations and even legislation, to target stable currencies such as USDT, remains to be seen.",1625734009,Vairlee,True,1,3,2021-07-08

Bitcoin,Is Bitcoin Legal,"**Bitcoin** was [legal](https://bnxnews.com/how-bitcoin-works-is-bitcoin-legal-guide-for-new-users/) in the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and numerous different nations as of June 2021. The legal status of Bitcoin in arising economies was still exceptionally factor. China has put a ton of limitations on bitcoin without making it illegal to claim it. India has prohibited banks from managing in bitcoins, and the legal status of digital forms of money is as yet undetermined. As a general rule, explore the enactment administering bitcoin in different countries. 

Regardless of whether bitcoin is legal, it is liable to the greater part of the very guidelines that apply to different resources. The most well-known region where individuals get into trouble is with tax regulations. Bitcoins are normally a property instead of money for tax purposes. There are occurrences, like **El Salvador**, which in June 2021 turned into the main country to perceive bitcoin as **legal money**.",1625728276,Salman50505,True,1,13,2021-07-08

Bitcoin,Specter Wallet failed to load.,"Hello everyone,

I am fairly new to the space of self-custody. I purchased a coldcard to attempt to take complete custody and learn more about the inner-workings of wallets and how they work.

I was successful in exporting skeleton wallet into specter and created the device, as well as the wallet, where I then transferred about .17 bitcoin over to the addresses on my wallet. Everything was good and all I needed to do was sign the transaction on my device, where I was getting confused and was going to reach out to a buddy for help to guide me through the process, since I dont want to plug my coldcard into my computer and sign it that way.

So I waited about a week, left as is, without signing the transaction on my coldcard. I revisited specter wallet today and now I am having a  trouble loading the the specter wallet I created for my coldcard.

This has me a bit worried, since the bitcoin is on the wallet that is ""failing to load."" hopefully I didnt do something wrong, but believe there might be away to recover this file I need, just not sure.   


Here is what I am seeing on my specter UI:

Bitcoin,I believe Bitcoin will have a market cap of $50 trillion or more one day. Here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶,"Bitcoin will one day have a market cap of $50 trillion. I believe this due to old money dying (baby boomers who love buying and holding gold) and the fact that roughly $70 TRILLION dollars will be passed down to heirs from rich mother fuckers to their spoiled cocaine induced rich brats‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry they prefer the term ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù‚Ä¶I apologize.

1. There‚Äôs estimated (per WSB) that $70 trillion dollars that will be passed down to heirs in the coming years.

2. Gold has a market cap of 11.458 trillion.

3. Bitcoin‚Äôs current market cap at the time of this writing is 638.59 billion. 
Current price is $33,331.40 

I believe that 30 years from now when the baby boomers eventually die, that no one will buy as much GOLD as they do now‚Ä¶and that the ‚Äúnew money‚Äù will purchase bitcoin, and put at least 5% of their total wealth in Bitcoin. 

Think of it like this‚Ä¶my best friend is extremely rich. Well‚Ä¶his grandfather is. Private jet. New cars. Trust fund. All that good shit. I believe that him, and rich kids like him will not buy gold. PLAIN AND FUCKING SIMPLE. 

New money will buy Bitcoin instead. Meaning that our current valuations are a gift if your bullish like me on bitcoin. So‚Ä¶like I said, there‚Äôs $70 TRILLION DOLLARS just sitting in a bunch of dusty old lady‚Äôs bank accounts. 

So I believe that gold will slowly wither away and the ‚Äúnew money‚Äù will be investing in real estate (rental properties, business, etc) and bitcoin as serious lifetime investments with their wealth. Let‚Äôs not forget about retail buying up and holding bitcoin as well, and the possibility of other countries adopting it as a currency‚Ä¶the possibilities are endless for bitcoin.",1625721330,King_Bum420,True,1,63,2021-07-08

Just buying BTC:

Capital gains of $965,000 taxed at 20% long term capital gains =&gt; $807,000 spendable.

GBTC:

2% expense ratio compounded over 30 years reduces gains to 1/1.02\^30 = 55% of the actual gain of BTC. Meaning you're essentially being taxed at a 45% rate, even in an IRA, just in the form of the expense ratio rather than a capital gains tax.

If people use large sum of Yuan to buy BTC from individuals, they would‚Äôve been tracked down by the police . All their banking system is under close surveillance.(locals only allowed to transfer out 50k usd per year).

My solution is simple, we could use gold to exchange into Btc. If people want to accumulate Btc without getting tracked by the government, all they could do is to change their CNY to gold/spot gold/ gold contracts ( perfectly legal ) and use gold to exchange for BTC ( untraceable by the banking system). All they need is just a soft/hard wallet.

Nonetheless one could argue that they could just hold gold instead of Btc to avoid all the hassles . But BTC is much more superior than gold and I shall not further expand here.

I received a random email that I had won a fair amount of BTC in a discord drawing and the page linked me to bitcoinspirex. Sure enough I go to bitcoinspirex and input the promo code and there the funds are input into my newly created account. Unfortunate for me I have never head of bitcoinspirex. There is no reddit page for the website, I have never seen any discussion of the exchange.

Then I get on the exchange, it looks nice, multiple pages with a solid layout, live chat where people responded to my questions and said it was a good option trading platform, then I que support and ask about retrieving these funds. Support was automated and this was the response.

""Dear user. Since our platform is fully automated and your account has no deposits with an active balance, the account will be automatically frozen and no Opitons Bets/Transfer/Withdrawal functions are available. To unfreeze and verify your account, you need to make a verification deposit of at least 0.01 BTC which you can then be withdrawn along with the remaining balance""

Now I am curious to what the deal is with this page because the winnings would make a deposit of .01 BTC feasible, but to think that this could all be a very well planned scam to get .01 which is about $350 Right now.

This is their claims:

""Cold storage for cryptocurrency funds

PCI DSS certificate

Strong relations with banks

Legal Compliance

MSB status in FinCEN (USA)

Registered with the ICO in the UK (EU)

Internal AML/KYC policy and procedures""

Idk why such a good 'tip' system hasn't taken off yet, are there any fundamental drawbacks or legitimacy concerns I'm missing out on? 

I really do see this going somewhere... maybe it'll become more well-known and accepted soon?

Bitcoin,Ukraine‚Äôs Monobank to Allow Customers to Trade Bitcoin,"**Monobank, a mobile bank operating in Ukraine, has announced new products and services that will allow users to trade cryptocurrencies and stocks. One of the offerings includes a bitcoin card that the online banking platform will launch as early as this month.**

## Monobank to Offer Users Bitcoin Card and Crypto Exchange

By the end of July, Monobank‚Äôs clients will be able to buy and sell cryptocurrency using a new banking card that will support crypto transactions. The news was announced by the company‚Äôs co-founder Oleg Gorokhovskyi on Telegram.

The Ukrainian mobile bank also plans to introduce an integration with a cryptocurrency exchange which has not been disclosed yet. According to sources quoted by Forklog, Monobank will accomplish the task in partnership with the crypto trading platform Whitebait.

Gorokhovskyi further emphasized that the development phase of the project is already completed. At this stage, Monobank is only awaiting approval from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), the country‚Äôs central bank.

This fall, the mobile bank will offer investors an option to trade company shares through a U.S.-based platform that is yet to be announced. Monobank‚Äôs team is currently working to introduce eSIM support with a mobile operator and improve its acquiring services. Both initiatives will be presented in August, the report details.

In February, Oleg Gorokhovskyi revealed he had ‚Äúa fairly large portfolio of bitcoins‚Äù and advised his friends and followers on Facebook to buy cryptocurrency. At the time, the entrepreneur stated he was convinced by Tesla‚Äôs $1.5 billion crypto purchase that ‚Äúbitcoin isn‚Äôt going anywhere.‚Äù

Later the same month, Monobank discontinued support for SEPA transfers from Binance citing restrictions imposed by foreign correspondent banks. The leading cryptocurrency exchange has been expanding its presence in Ukraine and launched an advertising campaign in major Ukrainian cities in June.

Last year, the East European country was ranked among the world‚Äôs top crypto adopters but the government in Kyiv is yet to introduce comprehensive regulations for cryptocurrencies and the related industry.

It just marches on no matter what you throw at it.  Every 2016 blocks it automatically adjusts itself to keep a 10 minute block time.  The game theory and incentive behind it's creation means it draws the most creative and innovative persons and technology to it's development.  It's decentralization allows it to give the finger to any country that bans it, and it's use of the Internet, which is the lifeblood of every advanced nation on earth, means that to kill it you have to destroy yourself in the process.  It makes HODLers of every person who buys it because it shakes people out, who then regret every day the sale they completed when it was so damn cheap.  It makes you feel like an idiot because you didn't get in earlier, and keeps kicking you in the ass for selling when you did.

Bitcoin,Smart contracts ELI5 + RGB POV,"In order to understand the concept of a smart contract one has to make a shift in their mindset - from thinking about Computer Science, blockchain, transactions to remembering how physical world works, about people interacting and proving something to each other. Imagine that there are no computers, they don't exist. After you design the interaction between humans and the way they can prove something in trustless or anonymous environments, the matter of digitalizing it by designing protocols that can fit it into computer and internet world becomes simply a question of application. You have to do first things first, meaning to design the game theory between humans and only then put time into contemplating computer science possibilities to make it work in digital form. This is also the best approach while trying to understand [RGB](https://www.rgbfaq.com).  


So, what is a smart contract in this perspective? **Smart contract** *is the way to enforce the fulfillment of a certain agreement between humans without an external centralized agency (military, government, court etc).* Say, you don't have a physical contract and the parties of the agreement are anonymous, meaning you can't use physical force to make them follow the agreement. If in these conditions there are economical incentives to make the fulfillment of the agreement happen without applying any physical enforcement - this is what a smart contract is. As you can see, it has nothing to do with Computer Science per se. Computer Science can help to solve cryptographic part of the situation, can make it more efficient working over Internet and not requiring physical presence, but it can't solve the game theory problems. For that you need to use economics first. And if you analyse the smart contracts from that perspective, you will understand that you have to distinguish many things, for example ownership rights (ownership of different assets defined under that conctract) from the contract states (under which conditions the contract exists currently, as each contract between humans defines certain, let's call them, state machines). Thus we can say that the contract defines an event-consequence algorithm 'if this happens then that happens'. And of course, each of these algorithms also needs to follow certain verification rules.    


If you think about [client-side validation](https://www.rgbfaq.com/glossary/client-side-validation) in this regard, it is easy to create parallels and understand that in the described scenario you need to run client-side validation with single-use seals (without any blockchain). Let's imagine someone gave you $10 for you doing something or paid you for coffee. When you got this bank note of $10, you perform a client-side validation: you look at the bank note, you touch it with your hands, you check the watermarks (which are single-use seals), and you either accept it or you don't. That's the client side validation happening without any computer being involved. Also, in this situation you don't need to have all the information about every single other note that ever existed (no need to store the global state). And the only thing RGB adds in this regard is it simply puts this paradigm of client-side validation into a digital world, utilizing cryptography such that you could do the same, but in anonymous way. This and similar use cases can be seen in many other situations beyond finance. And that's why we say that RGB covers smart contracts use cases and different enforcement rules under them, while still having the game theory designed outside of its scope.",1625659718,Olga_Ukolova,True,1,17,2021-07-07

&gt; **We visited ""Bitcoin Beach"" to See How Bitcoin Works in El Salvador. AMA!**
&gt; 
&gt; Vice News reporter Keegan Hamilton and Motherboard editor Jason Koebler are here to answer your questions about how Bitcoin is being used in El Salvador. ICYMI: El Salvador is the first country to adopt Bitcoin as a national currency. It all started with a tiny surf town called El Zonte that rebranded itself ""Bitcoin Beach,"" installed a Bitcoin ATM, and created a way for locals to do everything from buy pupusas to pay their utility bills with Bitcoin. The system does have some problems and El Salvador's nationwide adoption has many skeptics. We dug into how this all began, how it's working, and who stands to profit.

Both can be used for payments and as a store of value

Both rely on widespread consumer trust in order to function as a means of exchange

Fiat money is issued and controlled by (central) banks and governments

Bitcoin is produced and distributed through a process called mining and is not controlled by a centralised authority

Bitcoin can be trusted because it is tamper-proof and cannot be spent twice

A Bitcoin transaction cannot be reversed, cancelled or charged back",1625634599,Zalkifl_Savage,True,1,2,2021-07-07

Bitcoin,Lord Fusitu‚Äôa is Tongan royalty and a member of the Tongan government. He wants to implement Bitcoin as official currency like El Salvador.,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5b9DMQDB8I

https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-and-tonga-fusitua

&gt; On this episode of the Bitcoin Magazine Podcast, Christian Keroles sits down with Lord Fusitu'a of Tonga. Lord Fusitu‚Äôa is Tongan royalty and a member of the Tongan government. Lord Fusitu‚Äôa is a die-hard Bitcoiner and often spends time on Twitter spaces chatting with Bitcoin plebs from around the world. He tells the story of how Tonga relies heavily on remittances from Tongan‚Äôs living abroad and how much of those funds are lost to middlemen and rent seekers. According to Lord Fusitu‚Äôa bitcoin is already starting to take hold in Tonga on a peer to peer level, and he sees a viable path to implementing an El Salvador style bill to make bitcoin legal tender in Tonga.
&gt; 
&gt; Lord Fusitu‚Äôa has been working with both Jack Mallers and El Salvadorian officials to take the best parts of that law and amend it to fit into Tonga‚Äôs legal framework. Lord Fusitu‚Äôa believes that by embracing bitcoin, Tonga can become more competitive and wealthy compared to states that are slower to adopt the digital hard currency. He believes the Tongan people stand to benefit immediately just based on the remittances advantages that bitcoin offers. Lord Fusitu‚Äôa believes that these immediate advantages will turn into a culture of long-term saving on the islands.

This article will introduce the different benefit levels of ACH card in detail. The specific rights and interests are shown in the following chart:

The factor that determines the level of ACH bank cards is the amount of staking. The amount of staking for regular cards, silver cards, gold cards, platinum cards and black gold card requires ACH tokens equivalent to $30, $300, $3000, $30,000 and $300,000 respectively.

Different card levels of rights and interests include the following factors: credit rate for staking, card spending rebate, surcharge rate and travel benefits, as well as other privileges.

Credit rate for staking

ACH cards accept staking of different crypto assets to obtain the corresponding fiat currency quota. The credit rate for staking is the ratio between the amount of fiat available and the staking assets. The higher grade the bank card holds, the higher the ratio will be.

Card spending rebate At the time of ACH card spending, the system will give out ACH token rewards according to the level of the bank card and the consumption amount. The higher level the card holds, the higher rate of rebate it has.

Surcharge rate When using the function of ACH staking, the higher level the card holds, the lower the monthly charge rate will be.

Travel benefits Holders of different levels of bank cards can enjoy different travel benefits, including discounts on air tickets and hotel rooms, customized travel routes and free travel. ACH system will assign professional customer service, one-stop solution to solve your travel problems.

The details are shown in the following chart:

Offering air tickets at lowest price

Also, I offer **personalization**! I think that's a strength point, it's optional. You can enter your public address, then I transform it into a scannable QR code and print it on the back.

If you're curious, I'm partnering with Printful, so all products are mainly made and printed in the USA.

Feel free to check out our shop and don't hesitate to contact me for any information you would like to know.

By the way, we accept Bitcoin. You know, that's the spirit.

Your feedbacks are much appreciated.",1625617987,bitxecor,True,1,4,2021-07-07
Bitcoin,Friend has 2000 BTC locked. He said he lost the private key but he has access to the wallet,"Here is a video https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0qCFn-VfHaFAiojcVlFjdmA2Q#VIDEO-2021-07-06-19-28-32

He said the wallet was imported to that exchange. You can see it says in red Non-Spendable.

He has access to the phone he used to create the wallet.

Is there any way to find the private key? Going back to a previous backup and see some registry, file?

Currently picking between two courses. One is called Computer Networks and the other is Distributed Software Development. Here are the descriptions of the courses, respectively:

Network architecture and protocols, principles of network applications, socket programming, flow and congestion control, switching and routing, link-layer technologies, traffic capture and analysis, security.

Distributed system architectures and design, service-oriented computing, and frameworks for development of distributed applications and software components.

If the FATF guidelines become adopted across the world, and the Bitcoin universe becomes split into compliant VASPs and non-compliant entities, and VASPs are expected to manage ‚Äúrisk‚Äù of the Bitcoin they handle, won‚Äôt that create an incentive for some chain analysis company to give risk scores to every UTXO based on its transaction history, which can be combined to give an overall risk score to the holder of the coins, or a particular Lightning Node?

Doesn‚Äôt this seem inevitable? Could it even already be happening to some degree? Does Lightning Network hamper these efforts at all? Could that be a big reason for the lack of adoption (to-date) of LN by exchanges and institutions (i.e. the KYC risks)?",1625590755,jankis2020,True,1,1,2021-07-07

Bitcoin,Is my girlfriend a Bitcoin millionaire or a compulsive liar?,"Tldr: How can I verify my girlfriend's claim of owning at least one-million dollars of bitcoin without seeming too nosey about her finances? 

I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend from Spain for almost two months now and we had a conversation about finances last night. Despite working and living like a broke graduate student, she claimed that she has a lot of money in Spain. I asked if it was inherited money but I told her she didn‚Äôt have to answer if she didn‚Äôt feel comfortable saying. She then responded by saying it was money she had saved up while working for a large company based in Barcelona and subsequently the bar she and her mother owned and operated. 

I then asked if she was investing with her money and then she told me she had been investing in Bitcoin since she was 15 years old (so circa 2010) and that she started to seriously invest about 5 years ago. This was when my mind went wild since a few invested dollars could be worth thousands, maybe even millions. I asked her how much she had initially invested and if she had sold anything. She then said that she hadn‚Äôt sold anything and her portfolio would be worth more than enough to buy the house my grandparents had just bought (worth $1.4 million). 

Our conversation ended at that point but this naturally left me with lots of questions and doubts. 

What surprises me is that she claims to be living off of the money she is currently making by working, hasn‚Äôt spent any of her bitcoin, and is living well below her financial means. I first met her and her mother in Spain back in 2017, which would be before Bitcoin completely went to the moon, and they lived in a rather humble apartment in an average neighborhood. My girlfriend lived with her mom there until she came to the States in 2020. Her entire story seems plausible and I want to trust her, but I feel like I need to verify if it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôd hate to be too nosy about her personal finances because this proves as major evidence of her trustworthiness and this would honestly change the entire course of my life if got married. Do you all think she‚Äôs lying? what should be my best course of action to verify my girlfriend‚Äôs claim?",1625586069,SlothsForLife,True,1,63,2021-07-06

Bitcoin,Attacking large block shitcoin ?¬ø?¬ø?,"I have heard many times that larger blocks --&gt; centralization --&gt; compromised blockchain.

But I don't quite understand how that works! Help me figure it out.

1. Don't SPV wallets allow users to perform Merkle proofs on their transactions, checking that the transaction was included in a block and how many confirmations have occured since? What does a full node add to that security model?

2. No matter how many malicious spammy nodes signal the wrong information, wallet clients (both SPV and full nodes) still follow the longest chain rule, so as long as the right info reaches your client once, you are golden, no? Is this the objective of running a full node, making the right info reach everyone at least once, even in a sea of DoS?

3. So in conclusion, what is the attack vector that becomes possible in a blockchain with fewer full nodes, but isn't possible in a blockchain with more full nodes, all else being equal? What is your educated guess about the minimum/ideal number of nodes and why?

Bitcoin,Thought Experiment: What is the maximum potential of Bitcoin in terms of Price?,"# Spoiler alert: $60 Million...

Here's the roadmap, or at least what I believe *might* be the roadmap:

1) The first goal is to hijack the market cap of Gold and reach **$350 000.**

2) Then we'll take on The U.S. Dollar, and reach **roughly $1 000 000 per Bitcoin.**

3) The next step is to grab the bond market, which is valued at roughly $100 Trillion. This would sky-rocket the price of Bitcoin to about  **$4 750 000** 

4) If Bitcoin swallows all the money in the world, including real estate, the stock market, the forex market, and the futures market it will reach somewhere in the **$30 to $60 million range.**

In other words:

Bitcoin,What is the argument for corporations to adopt bitcoin other than distrust in the dollar and taking payment in bitcoin?,"So, no fud, just thinking aloud. I have been thinking about this a lot. I got very excited when microstrategy and tesla adopted bitcoin. But the more i think about it, I can't come up with a lot of reasons for a corporation to adopt bitcoin other than some form of speculation or just allowing customers to pay in bitcoin. And payment can be outsourced.

When I look at El Salvador on the other hand (or other Latin American countries) I can see very strong reasons for countries to adopt bitcoin. But for a corporation to speculate this early on in a currency/asset is kind of odd to me actually. Especially when it's money that should be working, not sitting in the bank. Am i missing something?

Bitcoin,2 very important events for BITCOIN AHEAD :,"1- Grayscale will have 41000 BTC unlock in mid of JULY which can impact in price going down as GBTC release has resulted many time before as well for BTC PRICE to go down . 
Good news is this is last release for Grayscale investors for GBTC release so after that there is 
2nd BIG EVENT FOR THIS season on 21st JULY 
That is Elon musk and Jack Dorsey Bitcoin meeting which can result in some bullish news for BITCOIN resulting in price to go up from there .

So for me we might see BTC price to go down with this final release of Grayscale GBTC and it will be followed with expected positive event for BITCOIN ! 

Right now market is in control with bears so GBTC release can have good impact to lower the BTC price and to hit our low targets and then we might hear 2-3 or even more positive news in market that is what i am expecting and can have good bullish month of AUGUST .",1625574917,_kr_saurabh,True,1,5,2021-07-06

Meanwhile my SPOT TRADING shows the volume bar normally.

Bitcoin,"A Beverly Hills Estate Asks $ 65 Million, or The Bitcoin Equivalent, To Take It Off The Market","A house in Beverly Hills is being sold for $65 million, which is also being paid for in bitcoin. At the current exchange rate, this is \~1930 BTC - potentially the largest real estate sale using digital assets.

Michael Chen, founder of Luxford Development Group, a real estate development company, said cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity in such transactions because it is easier, faster and cheaper.

Million-dollar homes in Beverly Hills are not uncommon, but this $ 65 million Beverly Hills land at 1108 Wallace Ridge in the exclusive neighborhood of Trousdale Estates, officially accepted the Bitcoin equivalent to get it on the market.

Bitcoin,It‚Äôs not worth risking a 5-6 figure gain over a few thousand dollars,"For a bit of context, I sold out of all my stocks in May after seeing Bitcoin drop from its ATH. Since then, I‚Äôve been waiting on the sidelines to buy in. In that time, my would-be stock positions have risen 20-30K in total while I‚Äôve been sitting on cash waiting for the right moment to buy into Bitcoin. 

I recently decided to say fuck it and pull the trigger on BTC at 33K. It dipped as far as 28K, and a part of me is kicking myself over the few extra .1 BTCs I could‚Äôve owned for the same $. However, the way I look at it, if this is really going to 100-150K within 1.5 years I‚Äôd have to be mentally ill to risk those types of gains over a few thousand per coin. And, if I could time the market like some god, I would quit my day job and just become a billionaire overnight buying weekly options. 

I think this is a really good price for Bitcoin and it still remains an asymmetric bet. Yes we could even revisit prior cycle‚Äôs ATH of 20K, but that‚Äôs highly unlikely and represents a 35% markdown from current prices. On the other hand, there is a very high probability of a move to six figures, representing a 200% gain (at least). 

Everyone has their own timeline and when to invest is their own decision to make. However, I feel pretty good about my decision to buy in recently. I‚Äôm no longer checking prices every 5 min, because I know even if I was wrong in the short term, it‚Äôs not by enough to worry about, and it‚Äôs not permanent. 

Also, I bought btc at 8K in 2018 and held it until 2020 when I sold at around 11K. It does hurt to have to buy less coins for 3X the price, but it‚Äôs also an irrationality to let your past positions dictate your future positions. If you think something is a good investment, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you sold it for in the past. 

Anyways, rant over. Just wanted to monologue a bit and point out some (probably obvious) irrational tricks our monkey brains can play on us. Bitcoin and crypto are a beast, and if you don‚Äôt have the right temperament, they will buck you.",1625537389,JeffGDoubleE69,True,1,285,2021-07-06

They've gone really downhill recently with their crypto articles but this is a fucking joke. It's an opinion piece written by a historian, and it's total nonsense. It doesn't even mention the cypherpunk movement, or the history of digital currency (e-gold etc.), a quick nod to Hayek and then framing it as ""right-wing"" without context. Comparing gov coins with Bitcoin, totally blindsiding any real use cases and the usual shit.

Then they shut the comments down after a few hours and ""picked"" some bullshit top comments, the comment chain is actually way more informative than the article. Loads of more informed info getting ""upvotes""

Honestly, fuck that paper. I'm gonna do the British thing and write them an email telling them I'm done with them haha - I emailed them before about paying for a subscription via bitcoin (just to see what they'd say) and actually got a well-informed, personal reply so they do read the emails you send them.

The comment section is funny, if you have half an hour spare it might be fun to quickly make an account with guerrilla mail, and upvote all the informed comments. Just to show the bias to anyone reading through the comment section who doesn't know about crypto.

Rant over haha, it's actually kinda funny how misinformed some mainstream articles are. Almost as if there might be some outside influence going on *wink wink nudge nudge*",1625527770,decentralized_bass,True,1,76,2021-07-06

Bitcoin,Powering 2x3090s and it's risers from a single PSU,"Hi everyone. I currently am planning a 4x 3090 mining rig. I have 2x EVGA 850W supernova GA power supply where I plan to have 2 cards and its risers on each 850W psu.

The 3090s I have require 3x 8 pin connections. The power supply provided 2x single 8 pin cables and 2x 8 single with a (6 +2) split.

Currently powering the 2x 3090s with no issue while they are connected directly to the board.

However, adding 2 cards and utilizing gpu risers I'm having a concern on how to power the risers.

Can anyone recommend how I power the 2x3090 and its risers from the 850W power supply?

I know I shouldn't use Sata and it seems like 2x risers on molex is also not advised.

Should I use an 8 pin cable split on the tail end of the 8 pin cable to power the gpu riser or is that also a fire hazard?

Do I need to upgrade the power supply just for extra 8 pin vga ports?

Bitcoin,"""My wife convinced herself and myself to not sell off our BTCs..."" [Explained]","Some of the community members complained about the incompleteness of my previous post \[[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/odfu8m/my\_wife\_convinced\_herself\_and\_myself\_to\_not\_sell](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/odfu8m/my_wife_convinced_herself_and_myself_to_not_sell/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\], therefore I would like to take the chance and explain the arguments in more details.

We have a portfolio of BTC, gold, ETFs and Rental real estates, and BTC is 25% of the entire portfolio ( and 100% of our Crypto portfolio). We started to buy BTC since 2018 in average price of \~24.000 Euro.

So the ""Hope"" for us is not only about the price action of BTC but mostly about the role it can play in the world financial system. BTC is a democratized, decentralized and incentivized financial system which leads to less corruption and power accumulation among those elites of the political groups.

BTC is a hope for people to secure part of their wealth against systematic inflationary economy. My wife's parents have worked 40 years and now are retired, their retirement is \~ 40 Euro per month!!! They have never had a chance to invest their money in any financial asset/market due to the established corruption in the government and financial sector. BTC is an anti-corruption system which is transparent and mathematically secured and predictable.

BTC is a peaceful financial system which did not establish itself through f\*\*king bloody wars, like petrodollar, so it is a hope to guarantee the future of our children. It is green and environmental friendly, since it allows anybody to plug Terawatts of renewable energy available around the world to its network. It is fair because it does ask your nationality, color, gender, race and etc. BTC does not believe in ""with us or against us"", so it is a hope.

I hope it could help.",1625515441,MiladMansory,True,1,3,2021-07-06

I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oga8Pwbq9M0) talk and was left with a couple of questions.

1. If miners get fees for what's going on in the side chains, then who will provide resources to validating what's going on in the side chain? Doesn't it need its own miners? And what do those miners get?

2. Why do we need to ""improve miner incentives""?

3. When he says we'll copy alts, does he mean we'll transact wrapped alts in sidechains? Or is he speaking of clones that can't be ""unwrapped"" into the underlying alt?

4. Paul says you can run a turing complete language on this. He also says you can't use BIP-300 sidechains to extract money from people. How do these two statements play together?

Although no company has come forward with the details on how the cyber attack has affected them, the number of attacks is expected to increase, says John Hammon, a security researcher.


REvil has asked their targets for a ransom of $70 million in¬†Bitcoin¬†for publicly decrypting their data within an hour, This leaves companies with one choice, to pay the ransom and wait for REvil to decrypt their data.¬†


The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have been working with Kaseya and coordinating to conduct outreach to impacted victims.¬†

I pray that that these companies find a solution and that no other companies are affected!",1625504128,the_damj,True,1,35,2021-07-06

Bitcoin,"A catfish mentioned a ""short term two-way income model"" for investing in Bitcoin. Is there really such a thing?","Hoping some of you can help me out! So I recently matched with a very sexy looking guy on a dating app and figured out he's a catfish.

First red flag I noticed was that he said he likes to stay at home and examine the trends of Bitcoin. I felt like he was using that line to dangle $$$ at me and probably all the other women he matches with. I also have been following Bitcoin for some time now. I asked him what his predictions were for this year and he said he recommended it as a short term investment (I've never heard of this kind of advice lol I always thought the opposite). I asked for more clarification and he said
 ""I am doing a short-term two-way income model, and I can make a profit whether it goes up or down"". 
I asked how short term and he said 1 hour. 

I want to know is that really a thing? I have never heard of it and also tried looking it up but did not see anything relevant. I just want to make sure this is another thing he made up as I would really love to tell him that I think his investment strategy is garbage. 

Anyway, I'm continuing to message with him because I'm also an asshole and would like to continue making subtle jabs at his ego.  My friend told me this is a common scam and he is going to ask me for money soon, so I'm waiting to see what happens!

In 2011 the Silk Road paved the way for selling drugs on the dark web. Here, anyone anywhere could buy any drugs they wanted safely and anonymously.

Eileen Ormsby, journalist and author of 8 books covering the dark web came on the show to discuss what was the Silk Road.

Bitcoin,How much bitcoin can each millionaire realistically own on average if bitcoin were completely adopted globally today?,"According to a recent article there is roughly 56.1 million millionaires worldwide (https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57575077). There is also approximately 18.75 million bitcoin mined to date. Doing some simple math, 18.75 mill / 56.1 mill gets us ~0.334 bitcoin for each millionaire. That would mean each coin would have a face value of $3 million.

However, the above calculation is not realistic. There is approximately 4 million bitcoin that is lost forever. So really we should be calculating 14.75 mill / 56.1 mill which gets us ~0.263 bitcoin for each millionaire. This would mean each coin would be worth almost 4 million dollars.

However, this is still not realistic. If bitcoin were suddenly adopted globally then that would mean all the countries in the world would have a bitcoin reserve. At this point I'm making up random numbers, but let's say all the countries around the world own 5 million coins all together. Let's also consider all the private and public companies in the world that would have their own reserve. Let's say these corporations together owned 2.5 million coins. That would mean there would be only 7.25 million coins left for the millionaires. However, we also need to consider the amount of coins all the non-millionaires would own... let's say all the non-millionaires make up 1 million coins all together.

This leaves us with 6.25 million coins for the millionaires. 6.25 mill / 56.1 mill gets us 0.111 bitcoin for each millionaire. Meaning each coin would be worth about 10 million usd. However, this is not even considering that some millionaires are vastly richer than other millionaires. We need to consider the millionaires that currently own hundreds of millions of dollars of assets versus the millionaires that only have 1 million dollars worth. This would mean each millionaire would have on average much less than 0.111 bitcoin. Wouldn't this put bitcoin at a value worth 10s of millions of dollars?

What are everyone else's thoughts on this? How much bitcoin can each millionaire realistically own on average if the whole world suddenly adopted bitcoin today?",1625501300,Expired_Lizard_Milk,True,1,9,2021-07-06
Bitcoin,Bitcoin ‚Äì The Future Currency,"Bitcoin (‚Çø/BTC) is a Cryptocurrency created in 2009 (by Satoshi Nakamoto) that has been devised for anonymous payments made entirely independently of governments and banks. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer (like giving your cash from your pocket to your friend or anyone) technology to work, no bank/government/financial establishment will track or interfere in your dealing. Bitcoin is an ASCII text file (open source) no one owns or controls Bitcoin and everybody will participate. People will send Bitcoin to every alternative through an app (Digital Wallet) on smartphones and computers. Every single dealing is recorded during a public ledger known as the blockchain. The Bitcoin conjointly exists in physical kind through ""Casascius Bitcoin"" created by American entrepreneur Mike Caldwell, the distinctive code of Bitcoin being embedded in a gold-plated coin, conjointly divided. Satoshi is that the smallest subdivision of a BTC such as ten BTC (0.000000000 BTC). alternative subdivisions are microbothoin (ŒºBTC) such as ten BTC (0.000001 BTC), millibitcoin or bit mil (mBTC) such as ten BTC (0.001 BTC) and centibicin or bitcent (cBTC).
In recent years, Bitcoin has generated an excellent deal of attention on many fronts. Bitcoin payments are supported a brand new attention-grabbing technical answer and performance otherwise from ancient payments. For sure payment things, Bitcoin will bring benefits within the type of lower prices, rapidity, anonymity, etc. over ancient payment ways. the employment of Bitcoin for payments is low nowadays, and though Bitcoin‚Äôs future is nice, it is a motivating innovation merit description. Currently, Bitcoin is poised between being a store of import and a medium for daily transactions.  Indian Rapper Raftaar has declared that he can settle for cryptocurrency rather than actual currency as his performance fee on June nineteen, 2021.
Institutional investors are needing to get in on the action and cash in on the volatility in its costs as governments around the world, like Japan, have declared it a legitimate type of payment for the product. Central American country (El Salvador) created Bitcoin monetary system on June nine, 2021. it is the primary country to try to, therefore. Bitcoin may be used for any dealing wherever the business will settle for it. The U.S. Dollar continues to be El Salvador‚Äôs primary currency.
Bitcoin‚Äôs functioning relies on miners validatory transactions. Incentives for them to try to therefore primarily contains new Bitcoins being assigned to miners as an award. The creation of recent Bitcoins declines over time. There will solely twenty-one million Bitcoin in future and approx. eighteen million Bitcoin already mined. a number of the consultants believe that the last Bitcoin ought to be mined within the year 2140.
 
We can list the dearth of notification and understanding. many of us still do not have the existence of Bitcoin. People must be compelled to learn concerning what Bitcoin suggests that to use it in their lives. Networking is that the best way to promoting Bitcoin. corporations settle for Bitcoins owing to the advantages; however, the list is comparatively short compared to physical coins. corporations like TigerDirect, Dell, NewEgg and buy-in settle for Bitcoin as a type of payment, which is nice. staff ought to be trained on Bitcoin to assist their customers. This may need your time and energy. Risk and volatility are 2 components that create an enormous disadvantage to Bitcoin. This is often volatile, particularly because there is a restricted quantity of coins and therefore the demand for them that will increase with each passing day. However, volatility is predicted to decrease as time passes. if several corporations, media and looking centres have begun to simply accept Bitcoin, its value can eventually stabilize. Currently, the Bitcoin value jumps from day to day, particularly because of the events related to digital coins.   
 
The success and way forward for Bitcoin are so not clear cut. All we all know is that the long run will not be because it is nowadays, and the way we tend to create payments in twenty-five or fifty years is an open-ended question.",1625500742,_kr_saurabh,True,1,3,2021-07-05

Bitcoin,I've just been scammed $200 and I feel terrible," 

So I feel terrible because I just got scammed $200 from a Bitcoin scam. I never post on reddit but I felt like I should this time just in case it stops anyone else falling for this trick. I'll post all the screen shots as well just so it's easier to understand.

Basically a guy called 'Bitmex Lightning Signals on Instagram 'who had hundreds of followers btw' had a free telegram signals channel which I joined, the last message in the channel was a post about advertising for 3 jobs that he had available. He basically just wanted people to help out his channel and answer questions that people may have he said he would pay $850 a week.

Now I can't believe I fell for this but being a uni student and being pretty broke I thought wow what an opportunity, I get to work in crypto and get paid a really good salary for it. He seemed very legit he had posts going back a good few weeks. So I messaged him said I was interested an replied saying great I'll start you off with a weeks trial and see how you get on.

However this is the scammy bit he said in order to join and get the links for everything I would have to join his VIP service which is 0.005 BTC. So foolishly I agree and sent 0.00577 BTC to him for the amount plus the fees. Again he seemed very legit he was asking me how I want to be paid and if I knew about erp systems and what my Instagram name was. But as soon as the BTC went through he blocked me on everything and has yet to reply to me.

I know this wasn't a load of money and I bet some of you make this of 1 trade but it's a lot of money to me and I feel terrible that this guy managed to scam me. If anyone has seen this guy before let me know I wish I had screenshotted his insta page and his telegram group so I could show you all.

Be careful out there guys I didn't think I'd ever fall for something like this but here I am.

This is where most people say we can just wait it out.

I would like to think, staking would have to exceed some duration or value threshold before my 1 year holding period increase 10 fold...or am i just dreaming?

Bitcoin,Best way to check wallet is up to date via RPC?,"I'm using scripts to talk to the bitcoin wallet and I'm trying to find out if the wallet is currently ""synced"" or if it's downloading blocks. 

Common answers to this are ""a wallet is never sycned, it's downloading blocks forever"" and ""compare the wallets block count in \`getblockcount\` with the value available on this webpage here.... yadda yadda.

This is a script that runs very regularly and it talks to many wallets, so making repeated HTTP request for each ""check"" is not feasible. And as far as the wallet ""always"" being out of sync, the wallet knows when to throw up the ""syncing"" splash screen. How can I know when that screen will be up, via RPC? 

My first attempt used three RPC calls:

\&gt; getblockcount  
\&gt; getblockhash $result  
\&gt; getblock $result

This gives me a result that includes the timestamp of the newest block. I declare the wallet as ""out of sync"" if that block is more than 45 minutes old. 

I was then able to turn that down to 2 RPC calls by simply doing:

\&gt; getbestblockhash  
\&gt; getblockhash $result

So here is the million dollar question. Is there a way I can get the ""timestamp"" of the last block on my local blockchain in just \*1\* RPC command? Or is there a way to just ask the wallet if it is up to date or not via 1 direct RPC command? 

Also, the 45 minute time just came from something someone said in a chat room once. If checking the age of the last block I have is still the best way to check for up-to-date-ness, by what methodology should I calculate what to use for an ""expiration time""? I'll need to do the same calculation for many other wallets. Thanks.",1625483293,l008com,True,1,9,2021-07-05

* Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh signed the ‚ÄúDecision No.942/QD-TTg‚Äù approving the country‚Äôs e-government development strategy, which involves assessing artificial intelligence, big data, augmented reality, virtual reality and blockchain technology.
* The cryptocurrency pilot program is expected to help the government discover the pros and cons while developing an appropriate management mechanism, Huynh Phuoc Nghia, deputy director of the Institute of Innovation under the University of Economics HCM City, told the publication.¬†
* Cashless payments are increasing in Vietnam and the recognition of digital currencies by the central bank would help accelerate this process, the deputy director said. ‚ÄúDigital money is an inevitable trend,‚Äù he said.

If it's possible to fashion a new signature that satisfies a transaction requirement even after an eltoo transaction is in the UTXO, and also makes previous signatures obsolete, won't it be possible to create a signature that authorizations a subsequent signature and transfer ownership?

Bitcoin,Who is better to use Bixin Wallet and Coinbase Wallet?,"What does a digital currency wallet mean?  
A digital currency wallet is a tool used to help you store, manage, and trade digital currency. Using the digital currency receipt address generated in the wallet, you can accept digital currency transfers from others to you, and you can transfer the digital currency you own to others. It is important to note that when you choose a wallet, you must choose a reliable and regular one, otherwise your assets may be damaged.

Who is better to use compared to Coinsign wallet and Coinbase wallet?  
Coinsign and Coinbase wallets are both digital currency wallets that have developed well in recent years, and it can be said that they have their own characteristics, so you can‚Äôt directly say which one is better to use. Next, I‚Äôll introduce them respectively.

‰∏Ä„ÄÅ BiXin wallet

1, theBixin wallet is relatively simple to use and medium security. It was founded in 2014, formerly known as HaoBTC wallet, in February 2017 the brand was fully upgraded to Bixin, and now belongs to Hong Kong Bixin Network Technology Co. Now the team brings together the earliest domestic bitcoin investors, bitcoin early evangelists, bitcoin underlying code contributors and so on, a team of bitcoin believers.

2. As the first bitcoin mobile social platform in China, Bixin App is people-centered, socialized to achieve information communication and value transfer, easy to play bitcoin, free and orderly. The real and rich community and the minimalist and extreme tools make Bixin a new way of life for more people.

‰∫å„ÄÅCoinbase wallet

1. Coinbase wallet is derived from Toshi wallet, which is redefining what users expect from a crypto wallet, and the security is still very good. This is not just a tool to access cryptocurrencies, you can see it as a foothold to explore the decentralized network.

2. With it you can manage ETH and all ECR-20 currencies, receive airdrops and ICO currencies, buy and store cryptocurrencies, trade cryptocurrencies with anyone anywhere without fees, buy and sell currencies through mass decentralized exchanges or proxy parties, and buy and sell cryptocurrencies with no fees.",1625476028,GroundbreakingOwl933,True,1,1,2021-07-05

The thing I don't understand is even if you have a hardware wallet, you still need a backup of that. Because if anything happens to that hardware wallet (hardware malfunction, gets lost, house burns down, forget your code) then you're still screwed.

So if you still need to write your pass phrase down on a piece of paper or in an USB key, why even have the hardware wallet?

Bitcoin,In the early days of Bitcoin ...,"
... how many coins could be mined in a day on a standard home PC?

I saw a guy being interviewed on a news channel the other day about Bitcoin.  Assuming he's telling the truth, he said he stumbled across Bitcoin in the very early days when it could easily be mined with a basic computer.  He said he was easily mining up to 50 coins a day but, given these were very early days for crypto, he didn't really know what he was mining (as in what they could be used for, potential value etc) so he placed no importance on it whatsoever.  So much so, he didn't retain the keys for many of his earlier coins Sad

He said he got back into it a few years back and is now a lot more careful about the crypto he has.  The guy could very likely have been a multi-millionaire by now.  Not sure if he's mining these days (doubt it) or buying/trading.

I find it surreal in a way that you can be sitting today deciding 'do I buy 1 coin for $50k?' whilst only a decade ago you could have been mining dozens of them, essentially for free, on your home PC!  Yeah I know that's all with the benefit of hindsight, however it makes me smile nevertheless.

What we were dreaming is now the reality.

We used to dream about prices above $20k, but now look at the price, it's way more above $30k, of course, we have had our ups and downs, our peace and war, agreements and disagreements, but now we stand victor, years of disbelief, understatement, hate speeches, haters, etc.

Holders of yesterday now are the winners, this is the fruit of their patience now, do not stop believing in Bitcoin, fight as you have fought before, go on and keep going, if you feel it's time to get out, then cash out and go home, if you still believe in the system, then keep holding and wait for the big turn ahead, because the ride has just started, and there is a long road ahead of us.

I would like to congratulate everyone who believed and stood by Bitcoin, hope to see more and big changes for us all in the years to come.

Bitcoin,Idea for an app to expand bitcoin commerce and get us all some more Sats. Someone wanna build it?,"The other night I was lying awake thinking about an app that should exist in the world. 

Most likely, we would all like to be paid in bitcoin for the every day things. Selling something on craigslist, splitting dinner with a friend‚Ä¶ stuff we would normally use cash or Venmo for. 

However, 90% of people still don‚Äôt use or hold Bitcoin, and those who do aren‚Äôt eager to part with it. 

So what if, instead, we built an app which *connects* to Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, or whatever (in my country there‚Äôs a few of these offered by the banks). They may not have an API, but we could build it so that the person pays OUR account with a unique identifier in the comments (generated by an iPhone app at the point of sale), and then we automatically buy Bitcoin on an exchange for that person and transaction. 

To avoid fraud, we could ‚Äúhold‚Äù the Bitcoin for however long is needed, showing the expiry date of the hold right in the app. I don‚Äôt know what the chargeback period is for Zelle or Venmo, but I think as long as you record in the app the person‚Äôs balance and when it will be unlocked, it would be fine. 

THEN, at the end of the hold period, we offer the option to move to your own wallet (I‚Äôm hardcore on self custody so I probably wouldn‚Äôt even make a full fledged wallet but rather encourage people to self custody). 

For this service and the risks incurred we could charge 5%.

I think it‚Äôs an interesting idea and a way to get more commerce happening on Bitcoin. 

I don‚Äôt know about you, but I don‚Äôt want shitty fiat when friends pay me back, and I know my kids nanny would love to accept Bitcoin if I were willing to use it - but for tax implications I prefer to pay her in fiat.

Bitcoin,Is mining doomed to end in big farms?,"

Hope I'm in the right board here but I guess the mining board is more about hardware. 

As we know the more miners the more difficult it gets to mine. So when there are for example 1Million pc's mining it doesn't matter if they are all in one basement or spread each across the world (Technical not fairness or whatsoever related). So the reason why bitcoin mining got so competitive and non usable with a normal desktop pc was because it got harder to mine. So how then does the vision of satoshi, that everyone validates and mines with his pc makes scene,  when its doomed to end in a few big mining farms? (In expectation of getting really popular) . Because due to the high difficulty nobody could mine on a pc, even if everyone would mine on a single desktop pc.

4. create more space on another Windows VM, installed latest bitcoin core client, re-synced.
5. imported same private key, expecting to see 0.999 btc.  instead saw 0.0 btc...  because the action in step #3 essentially moved the ""change"" of 0.999 btc into a potentially new private key that i no longer have access to since i deleted that Windows VM....

Bitcoin,One Satoshi is equal to a one Satoshi,"
Congratulations, dear ones, the future will remember you as the pioneers of the digital world. This is what I want to tell you is a personal opinion. 
In my opinion, Bitcoin is still the first way and like all other technologies, it is opposed first and finally matures with the acceptance of the general public.
I guess the higher the price of bitcoin, the less the price fluctuates, and this is the best tool for storing values.It comes to a standstill and solves the challenges that lie ahead.
I hope that the best inheritance we can give our children is bitcoin.Maybe then bitcoin will be a collectible like the coins of ancient Greece.But I can say with all my might that bitcoin never loses its value.

Bitcoin,In the early days of Bitcoin ...,"
... how many coins could be mined in a day on a standard home PC?

I saw a guy being interviewed on a news channel the other day about Bitcoin.  Assuming he's telling the truth, he said he stumbled across Bitcoin in the very early days when it could easily be mined with a basic computer.  He said he was easily mining up to 50 coins a day but, given these were very early days for crypto, he didn't really know what he was mining (as in what they could be used for, potential value etc) so he placed no importance on it whatsoever.  So much so, he didn't retain the keys for many of his earlier coins Sad

He said he got back into it a few years back and is now a lot more careful about the crypto he has.  The guy could very likely have been a multi-millionaire by now.  Not sure if he's mining these days (doubt it) or buying/trading.

I find it surreal in a way that you can be sitting today deciding 'do I buy 1 coin for $50k?' whilst only a decade ago you could have been mining dozens of them, essentially for free, on your home PC!  Yeah I know that's all with the benefit of hindsight, however it makes me smile nevertheless.

Bitcoin,The Bitcoin formula = reaching equilibrium,"n00b here ... trying to mathematically understand the relationship between market forces, price, hashrate and difficulty

I think ... its something along these lines:

Supply = newly mined bitcoin + (sold or exchanged bitcoin) - bitcoin lost forever

Demand = Determined by market forces, psychology, FUD, greed, whales, etc

Price = Demand / Supply 

Increasing price positively correlates with increasing hashrate

Increasing hashrate positively correlates with increasing difficulty

increasing difficulty drives globalized decentralization to mine areas with cheap electricity

once the difficulty (which is ultimately driven by increasing price (demand / supply) reaches a certain threshold, miners are more inclined to take profits, sell their bitcoin and turn off their machines, thus increasing the supply and dropping the price, dropping the hashrate and finally dropping the difficulty

low difficulty will motivate new miners to turn on their machines and the hashrate will creep up again

Bitcoin,"Suspicious 'Death' of Mircea Popescu, Large Bitcoin Holder (Fraud?)","Kinda sounds like the suspicious death of QuadrigaCX CEO Gerald Cotten.

Mircea Popescu, a controversial figure in the world of crypto, boasted one of the single-biggest bitcoin  fortunes and his amassed wealth in digital assets may be lost to the ether after his untimely death last month, some speculate.

Here‚Äôs what has been reported thus far.

Popescu 'reportedly' died off the coast of Costa Rica. Local news report say he was ‚Äúswept away by the current and died on the spot,‚Äù during a morning swim in Playa Hermosa de Garabito, Puntarenas.

The New York Post reported, citing comments from Twitter, that the Romanian crypto entrepreneur‚Äôs death was confirmed by three women who knew him. (probably he paid them to confirm his alleged 'death')

Popescu was viewed as a pioneer in digital assets and one of the earliest adopters. An article in¬†Bitcoin Magazine written by Pete Rizzo¬†said that Popescu was known for starting MPEx, a bitcoin securities exchange, around the same time as Coinbase Global¬†launched.

The Securities and Exchange Commission investigated MPex in 2014, and Popescu famously released a series of brash emails, where he defiantly questioned the authority of the regulator at the time.

Some estimates peg Popescu‚Äôs bitcoin holdings at 30,000 and he has made unverified claims that he held much more. At its mid-April peak this year, Popescu‚Äôs bitcoin holdings would have been worth nearly $2 billion but if estimates are accurate about his holdings they are worth about $1 billion today.

**What is unclear is how Popescu stored his crypto? Is it in a cold wallet, unconnected by computers, that only he holds the private key to, or is his cache of bitcoin held with a third-party.**

**Some speculate that he had a private key and that no one has access to it, which would mean that his fortune, whatever its size, is lost on the blockchain forever.**

‚ÄúAccess to Mircea¬†Popescu‚Äôs reported $2 billion in Bitcoin would only be accessible through his private keys, whether he stored them digitally or in cold storage like a physical Bitcoin wallet,‚Äù Voyager Digital CEO Steve Ehrlich told MarketWatch via email.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unclear if anyone besides¬†Popescu¬†has access to those wallets,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf there isn‚Äôt anyone who has the private keys to his Bitcoin storage, those coins could essentially be ‚Äòlost‚Äô forever in the sense that they will just sit in his wallets without the ability to be liquidated.‚Äù

This may be a frustrating outcome for Popescu and those close to him but at least one person appeared to be trying to be optimistic about a tragic story.

Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital Assets, in a since-deleted tweet said that the lost coins ultimately make the current supply of bitcoin more valuable since there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence.",1625418414,WatchYourCharts,True,1,3,2021-07-05

Bitcoin,Should Bitcoin store orphaned blocks after a large reorg to limit the damage of a 51% attack?,"For the first time in Bitcoin's history, we see exactly what could be a state level 51% attack by China, as we lost half or more of the total hash rate. I don't think it's likely but in theory it could be! Anyway suppose the following:

Suppose a secret longest chain is mined covertly without any transactions in the newly mined blocks. After a long time (say a year) this secret longest chain is revealed and all the transactions in that year are lost. Of course, this would be terrible for Bitcoin and the people involved. 

The only way we can defend ourselves against such an attack in my opinion is by keeping the orphaned blocks for some time (say a month) on disk after a (large) reorg. After this terrible attack nodes can then restart and demand that the last valid block should have a certain root hash, thereby making all the covertly mined blocks invalid. 

With this method, it's not necessary to change the Bitcoin protocol in any way (before the fact) and implement, for example, a maximum reorg limit. Implementing this feature would render a 51% attack practically impossible. What do you think?",1625417588,hMsats,True,1,15,2021-07-05

To justify their software that caused a fork in the blockchain, they claimed the Bitcoin network was too congested, helped create, and were contributing to the problem. These entities subsequently partnered with other prolific names names, attempted to changed the foundation that bitcoin was founded upon and failed. Thus creating Bitcoins bastard cousin we know today and the ""hash wars"" began in an attempt to solidify their fork.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Sentiment Analysis on Twitter,"The last months, a friend and I have been doing a project on **Sentiment Analysis**, focused on Twitter data and searching for correlations and causality with Bitcoin price. In this post we present our results. We though that some of you may like them. 

**If you don't want to read the whole post and just want a TLDR** or visuals, look for the plots downwards and for the conclusions. :3

**Introduction**

Something we've seen a lot, is people using the mean sentiment as the input for the correlation/prediction. Some examples of this can be found on [BitcoinTweet](https://bitcointweets.com/admin/dashboard)or [BittsAnalytics](https://www.bittsanalytics.com/sentiment-index/BTC). There are also some projects in Github such as the one from [CyberMetalPun](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/reddit-cryptocurrency-trading).

After trying to use the same method for a while, we found no good results using it directly with price. Using it against percent change may be a good idea, but we are not looking for short-term analysis or prediction, so we leave this to whoever wants to try it.

**Idea**

After forgetting about the mean, we though about developing a more precise formula. The formula needed to fulfill some rules:

1. The amount of tweets must affect the sentiment. There isn't the same sentiment if we have 1.000 tweets than if we had 1 million, even if the sentiment of the million is a little worse.
2. The interaction between tweets must affect the sentiment, but not in a linear scale.
3. Average sentiment must be represented in some way.

The resultant formula was

[Sentiment formula](https://preview.redd.it/lf3k384bn7971.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d12ce69924169c24127c68b6f04ae8dba436f0bb)

were **P** is a set of messages, **m** is a tweet, **s** is the sentiment, **l** the likes, **T** is the total number of tweets and **M** represents the average value(in this case, **M\_s** is the mean sentiment and **M\_l** the mean likes). The likes are counted as 1 + actual numer of likes.

**Data**

The data we used in this exploration were \~51 million scraped tweets from 2014 to May 2021 which mentioned either Bitcoin or BTC.

Duplicated tweets in the same day were filtered as spam since we kept having tons of repeated tweets from bots. They only represented a small fraction of tweets, but we preferred them out of our data.

We also used the minute to minute price of bitcoin in the same range of time, extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data) and Binance API for the last data. The gaps in the kaggle data were filled by copying the last non-zero value.

To extract the data we have implemented a software which can scrap the data from twitter and display some metrics in a dashboard.

[JABA Dashboard](https://i.redd.it/i16wtiqxv7971.gif)

**Method**

We have grouped the data on sets of half-hours and applied the formula to it.

For the sentiment analysis, we have tried some libraries, but Vader with custom lexicon seems to be the best analyzer right now.

**Results**

This is the result of applying the formula. We have also added the volume of tweets to the plot for reference.

[Linear Price, Sentiment and Tweet Volume Plot](https://preview.redd.it/s4n9y7kop7971.png?width=1347&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17f9d6a4e9cf75c3ac95186109271ca60f8f3aa0)

This is a log version of the plot

The correlation matrix is presented here

[Correlation Matrix](https://preview.redd.it/9vsh1jv0r7971.png?width=321&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b294d06fce4d571ac1bc57e8e545eec408381fea)

We can see that out metric is actually a more correlated variable than Tweet Volume, from where we can imply that the Sentiment sum is a valid metric for the Bitcoin market state. 

From the plot we can see some facts. The first is that the metric doesn't do well on short term volatility. The second one is that the metric seems to be a good macro metric from where we can detect Bitcoin price - Social Sentiment anomalies.

As a secondary result, we have also analyzed the correlation on shifted sentiment over price to see if there is some causality on them. What we could see is that the correlation maxed after 18, so we could say that ""sentiment was an indicator of the price of the next 18th hour"". When the sentiment was smoothed to avoid looking for spikes, the results where inverted. Correlation maxed 10 days prior, or, 'Price was an indicator of the sentiment of the next 10th day'.

**Conclusions**

We have found a good measurement for sentiment on Twitter and found that there seem to be a double causality between the sentiment and the price. The sentiment affects the price in the short term(18 hours), but the price affects the sentiment on a longer term (10 days). 

We have also implemented a program to scrap tweets, analyze data and plot it in a customizable dashboard.

**Code and Repo**

The code of this and the repo can be found [here](https://github.com/futotta-risu/JABA). The notebook of the metric [here](https://github.com/futotta-risu/JABA/blob/main/GlobalSentiment.ipynb).

**Future ideas**

Right now the formula is simple enough and works, but we aren't sure whether it is the best performing formula or whether it could be fine tuned with some hyper parameters, so parametrizing the formula and improving it is one of our main goals.

We also want to extend this to Reddit and News.

We want to solve the hight volatily moments where the formula explodes upwards due to the high number of tweets.

Bitcoin,Question/Strategy: Setting up Bitcoin automatic daily purchases for off peek hours.,"Ok, I‚Äôm considering setting up a daily purchase thorough an app. It mentions the purchases I‚Äôll be made at the same time of day.  (And I‚Äôm assuming I establish this with my first order placement)

I‚Äôve noticed that on a weekly basis some of the other coins I trade tend to dip down during the weekend and then pick up during the week. 

Also some of the more aggressive limit orders I place tend to trigger while I‚Äôm sleeping.  

My question is:

From your experience is there an hour or hours of the day that Bitcoin trades light? 

I‚Äôm in the New York (+5 hour) time zone.  And I am trying to figure out if it‚Äôs worth waiting until 4-5am to initiate this reoccurring purchase. 

My rational is two fold. 

1. I wonder buying during Off Peek hours will result in cheaper fees and faster confirmation times.

2. Having my purchases trigger more often during a lull in the international trading shifts (after hours) might possibly improving my cost average. 

Is my logic sound? Or am I way over thinking it?

everything was going good until the massive crypto crash in june when bitcoin managed to go to 28,000$, initially i went long at 31,000$ at 50x margin, cuz the weekend was over, and it would normally like every week pump back up, i had invested about 40% of my total money, into it and forgot to put a stoploss, a hours later i come back to my computer to see btc touches 29k, and i had a risk of about 89%, and binance decided to eat up the res 60% of my money to prevent liquidating my amount, now since 29k was the ATL, just so i thought, the son of a bitch managed to go to frikin 28k and bam!, lost all my invested 15,000 invested inr in the crypto market

i now totally feel like a 19 year old dumbass and a total loser, and i understand that i fucked up real time, is there any way i can leave this behind, and get away from my stocks, crypto, forex and everything that requires investing so i can atleast keep the cash i have left, also feeling a bit suicidal and having a existential crisis, a few kind words can really be appreciated,

I'm not interested in these countries but the ones where it is possible to declare and pay bitcoin tax.
I will start first.
In Croatia, several years ago we received clear instructions from the tax office on how to file a bitcoin tax.
In short, we must lead FIFO and if we can prove that we held btc funds more than 2 years, than we don't need to pay tax (long term investment).
If we have kept btc funds for less than 2 years, we pay 12 % tax plus surtax.

Will it only be used for investing/speculation as long as its price is this unstable? Can you imagine a normal acting like bitcoin does?

Bitcoin is well-known in cyberspace as it's often proclaimed to be the ""currency of the Internet"". There are a lot of education material about Bitcoin either in the form of a book, a web article, or a video tutorial. This is great since it helps spread awareness for Bitcoin across the Internet. But something else is missing for Bitcoin to reach a wider audience. It's yet the day where Bitcoin isn't promoted/marketed on TV. Seniors aren't connected to the Internet as much as young people are, but they are mostly watching TV. All it takes is for someone to air a commercial about Bitcoin on TV, and the pioneer cryptocurrency will be on a road towards non-stop growth in the mainstream world. Add to this a movie related about Bitcoin and you'll see demand rise like skyrocket in no time.

""how good the project is, what the idea is all about, team etc)

It‚Äôs been a year since I entered the currency circle. After experiencing bulls and bears, I still look at the future instead of looking back at the past time. I am full of joy for the future. I also feel that his birth and development have spread to the whole universe in the past ten years. Announcing that there is a new thing on the earth that humans cannot interfere at all. As long as humanity is greedy and selfish, there will be countless human individuals holding Bitcoin, opening nodes for him, and mining for him. Although the current market oscillates in a space, it does make people feel very tortured, and sometimes I feel that my chest is suffocated. Grin Grin Grin
Bitcoin is the first existence independent of the existence of human civilization after the birth of human civilization on the earth. Its quadratic elliptic curve encryption and the packaging and verification system attached to human society are completely immune to humans. Quite terrible, quite remarkable. Imagine that since the birth of human civilization on the earth, human beings can control everything at will. Everything can be said to be under the control of humans, even cancer, AIDS, etc. will be controlled by humans sooner or later. But humans just can't control Bitcoin, whether it is reverse cracking the private key or successfully attacking the entire package verification system, humans can't do it. So in fact, Bitcoin, born in 2009, is already a new civilization.

I want to call it a kind of machine civilization, using technology, mathematics, cryptography, and philosophy to form the underlying blockchain technology to constrain humanity and establish a new economic order, or in the near future, I hope to use the forum The study, constantly improve my own cognition, and become a valuable member of this civilization, to bring my views to everyone, and to help everyone.",1625380790,sverlinas2,True,1,3,2021-07-04

Bitcoin,How many scammers have you funded by putting your money in?,"
I think there's no shame admitting that we make mistakes, that's where you learn from. Sometimes even with DYOR, legit looking projects turn out to be scams. And sometimes we just want to risk it.

During last bullrun ico frency 2017-2018 many people were saying that ICO scams are now over and next time people will be smarter. However now there are more scams then ever, especially rug pulls in uniswap and pancakeswap. We just don't call them ICOs anymore.

My failures of judgement contain 2 icos from many years ago which were obvious scams in hindsight : Swiss Alps Mining, Envion and one latest where Dev disappeared after i aped in to some BSC shittoken for the hopes of 2x-10 flip (i can't even remember the name of it).

Luckily i haven't invested anything i couldn't lose (to scams anyway), and i have even made money with investing to something that turned out to be scam later on. But still they are obviously annoying.

So i would like to hear your stories on how did you get scammed. Was it because you aped in without research or something else?",1625379809,serhr792,True,1,6,2021-07-04

I'd be a lot more enthusiastic if I saw these 3 drawbacks being addressed.","I'm not saying that these problems are insoluble, just that I haven't heard the solutions yet, and this seems like a good place to look for answers.

1) The tactics I've heard to prevent being tortured to turn over your private key don't cut it. They include arming yourself, being cautious, and keeping mum that you even own Bitcoin. But look down the road a bit, say 40 years. If Bitcoin becomes our primary currency, that everyone owns, you can safely assume that the guy in a pricey zip code with a Maserati has plenty of Bitcoin, just like we can now assume that he has plenty of dollars.  Kidnappings and home invasions would be through the roof.  Well-paid professionals would need bodyguards 24/7.  

2). If the cost of energy were to drop dramatically (say 98%) as a result of new technology, would proof of work still matter? (If there are no hard costs, but only time to mine Bitcoins?) Our current tech would seem like magic to a person from 50 years ago, so who knows what the next 50 years will bring?

3). With every transaction recorded in the blockchain, are we sure there is no way for governments to identify who paid x satoshis for a night with 3 hookers and cocaine? Be a shame to have that info sent to your wife.  

I sincerely hope that all the shouting about Bitcoin is justified. If anyone can shed light on these concerns, I'd be most grateful.",1625370920,rabbits_dig_deep,True,1,116,2021-07-04

Bitcoin,"I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt want to be a shitcoiner","I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt want to be a shitcoiner. That‚Äôs not my business. I don‚Äôt want to deceive or rob anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - rich, poor - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other‚Äôs happiness - not by each other‚Äôs misery. We don‚Äôt want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.  


Greed has poisoned our souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost‚Ä¶  


The internet and the mobile phone have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in people - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my post is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes humans torture and imprison innocent people.  


To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of those who fear the way of human progress. The hate of people will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as humans die, liberty will never perish‚Ä¶  


Bitcoiners! don‚Äôt give yourselves to brutes - people who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don‚Äôt give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men and women! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don‚Äôt hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Bitcoiners! Don‚Äôt fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!  


In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: ‚Äúthe Kingdom of God is within man‚Äù - not one man nor a group of men, but in all! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.  


Then - in the name of freedom - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give us a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!  


Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all humankind happiness.

Bitcoin,Concerns about privacy. Can we have a little discussion?,"Recently, i have been thinking about privacy and Bitcoin.

I know that Bitcoin is pseudonymous, as you can track every adress. It is somehow private in a way that nobody know who own which adress. Atleast until you glue your name to some of them.

If you buy through KYC service with fiat like coinbase or Binance, they have this one line that says ""date, amount, name, verification of ID, adress where it went"" and from this time they can track everything you did with your money.

Arent you afraid of your government? Until US passed executive order on gold confiscation, nobody thought that could happen.

Dont you think that they can do the same with bitcoin? They know everything they need and even if you dont have it anymore, you have mark on your skin... only way how to prevent them is buying though non-kyc or old P2P with cash.

There are other reasons. Tracking, social problems because they can prove you re ""dirty energy waster and you are probably molesting kids"", there might be persecutions and basically have to obey every law of taxation and persecution, because they KNOW you boght coin.

Arent you concerned about some of those scenarios? 

They might seem like the worst one, but every day we are losing our rights and this is not different. It might be much faster in future, if governments see their power vanishing with fiat currencies value and trust.

 There's all combinations of used and new units that seem to be right up there in capability with the PI4 series.

Build a satellite and mount your mining device on that baby. In case of power, just stick a nuclear battery on it.

3. Step:

Launch that satellite into the space and let it fly with the highest possible speed into the Orbit of an black hole. 


Now you're done. You have the worldwide fastest minding machine! Because of the rising speed of your satellite, wich is slowly getting sucked into the black hole while it's spinning on the Orbit, relatively the time will slow down for that satellite.

I am looking for initial interest, and I will do the leg work.

So I was just informed of how scary it is for pediatric cancer survivors to exist in times of covid. Would your exchange sponsor help us donate crypto to an accredited charity to help improve the quality of life of kids with terminal diseases and compromised immune systems?

I was thinking of bringing video games especially VR to hospitals to give an escape.

I think this will help adoption and be amazing PR for crypto as we know, all while doing something awesome in scary times.

The idea is simple:

We get exchanges to allow users to dust their accounts of tiny odd crypto and donate it to a cause.

(e.g. we get the charity to set up a wallet(s), and the crypto goes directly to them.)

I have had preliminary very early conversations with folks at Childrens Miracle Network, Cals Angels and Lurie's Childrens. They are skeptical of crypto as a whole, but like the idea if it was all on the up and up.

But it closed out the first half of the year down about 47% from its record.
A number of looming risks could result in further pain ahead.
Bitcoin had a solid start to 2021, hitting an all-time high of nearly $65,000 in April. But the digital coin closed out the first half of the year down about 47% from its record ‚Äî and a number of looming risks could result in further pain ahead.
While proponents appear to be holding onto bitcoin for now, other investors are wary about wild volatility in the market and what it means for their portfolios. With that in mind, here are five of the biggest risks facing the cryptocurrency as we enter the second half of the year.
Regulation
One of the biggest risks for bitcoin right now is regulation.

In recent weeks, China has clamped down on its cryptocurrency industry, shuttering energy-intensive crypto mining operations and ordering major banks and payment firms like Alipay not to do business with crypto companies.

Last week, the global crypto crackdown spread to the U.K., where regulators banned leading digital currency exchange Binance from undertaking regulated activities.

Simon Yu, co-founder and CEO of crypto cashback start-up StormX, told CNBC that China‚Äôs moves should be viewed as a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù thing for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like ether as it will lead to more decentralization. However, he added that ‚Äúover-regulation‚Äù of crypto in the United States could be a problem.

However, he added that ‚Äúover-regulation‚Äù of crypto in the United States could be a problem.

‚ÄúAs a country, the U.S. has too many departments regulating it from different angles ‚Äî is crypto a security? A commodity? A property?‚Äù Yu said. ‚ÄúAs of now, the U.S. hasn‚Äôt figured out how to properly regulate the industry, which oftentimes leads to decisions that are difficult for crypto to operate.‚Äù

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other officials have recently warned about the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit transactions.

Last year, former President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration proposed an anti-money laundering rule that would require people who hold their crypto in a private digital wallet to undergo identity checks if they make transactions of $3,000 or more.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve long warned that shifting investor sentiment or regulatory crackdowns could pop bubble-like crypto markets,‚Äù UBS wrote in a note this week.

Volatility
Another big risk is persistent, extreme swings in the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies.

Bitcoin rallied to an all-time record of around $64,829 in April this year, on the day of crypto exchange Coinbase‚Äôs blockbuster debut. It then tumbled as low as $28,911 in June, briefly sliding below $30,000 and turning negative for the year. It‚Äôs since risen back above $34,000.
Bitcoin bulls see it as a kind of ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù ‚Äî an asset uncorrelated to the wider marker that could provide sizable returns in times of economic turbulence. But while volatility can be good when the price of an asset is going up, it goes both ways.

While you would have doubled your money if you bought bitcoin in January and cashed out in April, today those year-to-date returns would be 18%. Still, that‚Äôs above the performance of the S&amp;P 500 index, which is up 16% since the start of the year. And over the last 12 months, bitcoin has more than tripled in price.
‚ÄúLimited, highly inelastic supply on single cryptos can exacerbate volatility,‚Äù says UBS. ‚ÄúLimited real world use and extraordinary price volatility also indicate many buyers are seeking speculative gains.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the trend of traders who have made highly-leveraged bets on bitcoin getting flushed out of the market has led to intense price fluctuations this year.

While continuous volatility could put off some investors, Ross Middleton, chief financial officer of decentralized finance platform DeversiFi, said that volatility in itself isn‚Äôt a barrier to institutional adoption.
Volatility ‚Äúcan actually be a significant draw as the potential for large price movements means that funds can make significant profits with a relatively small allocation compared to the size of their overall portfolio,‚Äù he told CNBC.

‚ÄúThe longer that Bitcoin moves sidewards in the $30-$40k range,‚Äù Middleton added, ‚Äúthe greater the perceived ‚Äòbase-building‚Äô and the sooner that new capital will flow into both the asset and the wider crypto market.‚Äù
Environmental concerns
Questions surrounding bitcoin‚Äôs impact on the environment could be another big headwind for the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin mining equipment requires lots of electricity to run, and bitcoin‚Äôs energy consumption has risen considerably over the years in tandem with its price.

While bitcoin‚Äôs critics have long warned of its huge carbon footprint, Tesla CEO Elon Musk brought the issue back to the fore this year.",1625339922,nduquivera,True,1,2,2021-07-04
Bitcoin,Bitcoin mining is now easier and more profitable as algorithm adjusts after China crackdown,"More than 54% of bitcoin‚Äôs hashrate, which is the collective computing power of miners worldwide, has dropped off the network since its market peak in May.
The bitcoin code has re-calibrated to make it 28% less difficult to mine.
Miners who are still plugged into the network stand to make greater profits while most of the network‚Äôs miners remains offline.
It just became a whole lot easier and much more profitable to mine for bitcoin.

The world has known for months that more than half the world‚Äôs bitcoin miners would be going dark as China cracked down on mining. Now that it‚Äôs happened, the bitcoin algorithm has adjusted accordingly to make sure miner productivity doesn‚Äôt continue to fall off a cliff. 

That adjustment ‚Äì which took effect early Saturday morning ‚Äì also means that way more cash is going to the bitcoin miners who remain online.

‚ÄúThis will be a revenue party for miners,‚Äù said bitcoin mining engineer Brandon Arvanaghi.

‚ÄúThey suddenly own a meaningfully larger piece of the pie, meaning they earn more bitcoin every day.‚Äù
Mining made easier
A bitcoin miner runs a program on a computer to try to solve a puzzle before anyone else does. Solving that puzzle is what completes a block, a process that both creates new bitcoin and updates the digital ledger keeping track of all bitcoin transactions. 

China had long been the epicenter of bitcoin miners, with past estimates indicating that 65% to 75% of the world‚Äôs bitcoin mining happened there, but a government-led crackdown has effectively banished the country‚Äôs crypto miners. 

‚Ä≥For the first time in the bitcoin network‚Äôs history, we have a complete shutdown of mining in a targeted geographic region that affected more than 50% of the network,‚Äù said Darin Feinstein, founder of Blockcap and Core Scientific. 
More than 50% of the hashrate ‚Äì the collective computing power of miners worldwide ‚Äì has dropped off the network since its market peak in May.
Fewer people mining means that fewer blocks are solved each day. Typically, it takes about 10 minutes to complete a block, but Feinstein told CNBC the bitcoin network has slowed down to 14- to 19-minute block times.

This is precisely why bitcoin re-calibrates every 2016 blocks, or about every two weeks, resetting how tough it is for miners to mine. On Saturday, the bitcoin code automatically made it about 28% less difficult to mine ‚Äì a historically unprecedented drop for the network ‚Äì thereby restoring block times back to the optimal 10-minute window. 
The bitcoin algorithm is programmed to handle an increase or decrease in mining machines, according to Mike Colyer, CEO of digital currency company Foundry. ‚ÄúIt is a self-regulating market that does not require any outside committee to determine what to do. This is a very powerful concept,‚Äù he said.
Fewer competitors and less difficulty means that any miner with a machine plugged in is going to see a significant increase in profitability and more predictable revenue.

‚ÄúAll bitcoin miners share in the same economics and are mining on the same network, so miners both public and private will see the uplift in revenue,‚Äù said Kevin Zhang, former Chief Mining Officer at Greenridge Generation, the first major U.S. power plant to begin mining behind-the-meter at a large scale. 

Assuming fixed power costs, Zhang estimates revenues of $29 per day for those using the latest-generation Bitmain miner, versus $22 per day prior to the change. Longer-term, although miner income can fluctuate with the price of the coin, Zhang also noted that mining revenues have dropped only 17% from the bitcoin price peak in April, whereas the coin‚Äôs price has dropped about 50%.
‚ÄúWe are expecting a period of much higher mining profitability for Compass Mining clients,‚Äù said Whit Gibbs, CEO and founder of Compass, a bitcoin mining service provider. ‚ÄúWe expect miners to be approximately 35% more profitable.‚Äù

Blockcap‚Äôs Feinstein agrees. ‚ÄúWe are expecting a revenue and profit increase for the foreseeable future.  This was an unexpected gift to the network, not just on revenues but on decentralization and sustainable energy metrics.‚Äù

Although the difficulty drop benefits all miners, those using new-generation equipment stand to benefit the most.

Feinstein tells CNBC that most of the gear in China that was turned off was old-generation equipment, which is inefficient and runs on much smaller profit margins.  
Six-month surge
It is hard to predict how long the hashrate deficit will last. Barbour said that it is totally possible that Beijing could simply reverse their policy, and this could only be a short-term interruption. 

If not, most mining crypto experts agree that it will take anywhere from six to 15 months for all of that idle and displaced mining hardware to migrate. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to take a long time for the surplus to find a home,‚Äù said Barbour. 

Gibbs thinks miners should see heightened revenue for at least the rest of 2021.

‚ÄúEvery day the Chinese miners are searching globally for places to turn their machines back on. There is very limited space at the moment,‚Äù said Colyer.
Part of the problem, according to Feinstein, is that even before China cut off mining, there was already a lack of infrastructure to house the new-generation miners being deployed monthly by Beijing-based manufacturer Bitmain.

Now that the market is flooded with an over-supply of used mining rigs, it is tough to say how fast countries will be able to absorb the influx of gear. 

‚ÄúSome mining companies have had everything built and were just waiting for these ASICs to plug in, which would only take a couple days,‚Äù explained Arvanaghi.

‚ÄúOthers may need to build containers, extend warehouses, or increase their power capacity. We won‚Äôt see the hashrate reach what it used to be overnight, but we‚Äôll see it tick back up over the next few months,‚Äù he continued.
Of all the possible destinations for this equipment, the U.S. appears to be especially well-positioned to absorb this stray hashrate. CNBC is told that major U.S. mining operators are already signing deals to patriate some of these homeless Bitmain miners. 

U.S. bitcoin mining is booming, and has venture capital flowing to it, so they are poised to take advantage of the miner migration, Arvanaghi told CNBC. 

‚ÄúMany U.S. bitcoin miners that were funded when bitcoin‚Äôs price started rising in November and December of 2020 means that they were already building out their power capacity when the China mining ban took hold,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great timing.‚Äù

But Barbour believes that much smaller players in the residential U.S. also stand a chance at capturing these excess miners. 

‚ÄúI think this is a signal that in the future, bitcoin mining will be more distributed by necessity,‚Äù said Barbour. ‚ÄúLess mega-mines like the 100+ megawatt ones we see in Texas and more small mines on small commercial and eventually residential spaces. It‚Äôs much harder for a politician to shut down a mine in someone‚Äôs garage.‚Äù",1625339764,legionaryexes61,True,1,5,2021-07-04
Bitcoin,Here‚Äôs what cryptocurrencies will look like in 50 years according to experts,"We may not know what stocks in the S&amp;P 500 will do next month, or in two years, but over the decades, we have a pretty good hunch that they‚Äôll go up. Most of us also know what a stock is, and that definition hasn‚Äôt changed in centuries.

None of that is true, of course, with cryptocurrencies. Some predict the coins will forever change how we understand and interact with money and others warn of a dangerous bubble.

But whatever a person forecasts for cryptocurrencies, it‚Äôs getting harder to imagine a future without them.
CNBC asked experts from a variety of fields to describe their vision for the currencies 50 years from now. Their answers have been condensed and edited for clarity.

‚Ä¢ Ivory Johnson, certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management

‚ÄúCryptocurrencies will disrupt traditional finance because one of their most attractive utilities is the ability to efficiently transfer payment across borders with little to no cost, delay or foreign currency fluctuations. With respect to bitcoin, 50 years is a long time and bitcoin could either become the world reserve currency or the next AOL that made a lot of people wealthy until it was unseated by better technology.‚Äù
‚ÄúWay before 2071, the dollar will have more in common with a crypto than with silver or gold, so there is no need to doubt the longevity of encrypted algorithms as stores of value and media of exchange. All money is a form of encryption. It‚Äôs been that way from the start, and as our lives converge ever more closely with the digital universe, the drive to invest in tokens will only accelerate. Ironically, that impulse will connect us to primitive instincts, and do its part to keep us human.‚Äù
‚ÄúCryptocurrencies like bitcoin have proven themselves useful for money movement and speculation, and they‚Äôre unlikely to go away. But where and how we‚Äôll generate the energy to meet the demand of a growing crypto market is worth considering, as well as whether state-actors who view it as a competitor to fiat power will make it even more of a black-market commodity.‚Äù
 Dragan Boscovic, founder and director of the Blockchain Research Lab at Arizona State University

‚ÄúCentral bank authorities are busy developing regulations on cryptocurrency. They recognize that digital currencies are native to the digital economy and, as such, are on their way to becoming mainstream in the next 10 years.‚Äù",1625339500,boggyboarding08,True,1,4,2021-07-04

I was wrong, at least with bitcoincore 0.21.1, and I don't get why I can still emit valid blocks with just the Proof Of Work.

i am pretty new to the space, but dove into the rabbithole failry quickly. I was searching for a secure and cheap way to DCA.

The fees are unacceptable on all of them and the latter three are located in Switzerland which is annoying because i have to send EUR to CHF.

Then i stumbled over this Docker Image: 

[https://github.com/Jorijn/bitcoin-dca](https://github.com/Jorijn/bitcoin-dca)

Via the Kraken API and this Guys docker container you can execute commands, like:

* buy btc with funds on your kraken account
* withdraw to a specified btc address
* get balance

By setting cronjobs you can specify the intervals at which btc is bought or withdrawn to cold storage.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin is still the favorite choice,"
An important reason for Bitcoin's popularity is that it has withstood the test of time. No digital currency has experienced so many ups and downs like it. It has been discussed many times around the world, and  tenacity of its vitality also proves its value from the side.
Moreover, Bitcoin is the most widely-consensus digital cryptocurrency, and it has a strong international circulation. The total amount of Bitcoin is constant at 21 million, and it is halved about every four years. It is scarce. In addition, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer transaction transmission, free from the intervention of various institutions, and can circulate around the world. You can send your Bitcoin to any corner of the world. Coupled with the fact that Bitcoin has higher returns than gold. Digital currency or encrypted assets represented by Bitcoin is the general direction of the development of the entire financial industry.
The great investor's enthusiasm over Bitcoin is based on its overall progress during last decade, it is proven only crypto asset that surpasses the expectation of investors and breaks the previous record highs.

Bitcoin,Idea: Egress Bandwidth Marketplace Built on Lightning Network,"Hi Everyone,
 Here's an idea that i don't have time to build (young kids, aging parents, full time job) but i would if i could:

A bandwidth marketplace on top of lightning network. Anyone can offer up their own bandwidth for sale via something running on their lightning node. People would quote their location and the amount of bandwidth they are willing to sell, maybe in 30 minute chunks.  

When someone decides to purchase this bandwidth, both parties make a note that the transaction is about to start, maybe via some small transaction via lightning. At the end of the transaction, each party could rate the other in the transaction.

This simple market place could then lead to a record of 'reputable node operators' as well: anyone could look at a record of previous successful transactions like this, when deciding whether to engage in future transactions.

One obvious use case here could be like a cheap, wildly distributed VPN that's almost impossible to distinguish from a commercial VPN. 

It's not too hard to imagine an ecosystem of little services like this, powered by reputation.  Bandwidth seems like a simple, obvious first step: then, compute and (possibly last, once people had really long-lasting reputations), storage.",1625320799,gomboloid,True,1,1,2021-07-03
Bitcoin,The easiest and cheapest way how to handle multiple transactions - send to many (batch payments),"I am looking for some common sense and simple advice how to send multiple payments from BTC wallet to many people (for example 20 people with 20 different amounts). The goal is to have a low transaction fee. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some wallets support send to many:   
\- BlueWallet (seems easy enough and I tried it)  
\- Bitcon Core wallet - didn't try it, but I have node running (not sure if there is any advantage)  


Another thing what seems important is the number of incoming transactions into the wallet. I have many small amounts coming from different pools (mining proceeds). Now I am thinking to change payouts to higher amount so the payouts do not come every day, but for example once a week. The assumption is that I get 1 input instead of 7 inputs. 

Would the above make the biggest impact ? 

&amp;#x200B;

For sending I plan to use BlueWallet.. send to multiple. Multiple receivers/transactions in one.. and then just one transaction fee. 

&amp;#x200B;

How much should I worry about change output i.e. spending the whole amount in the wallet including the transaction fee.  I read somewhere that the change output is 32 vbytes. So it doesn't seem like a huge amount. 

Can someone confirm if there are any holes in this? Or if it makes sense?",1625320692,Brunnervac,True,1,0,2021-07-03

Bitcoin,"Things of investing (again, I'm an idiot)...","So, I guess I have a longer story than some with bitcoin, even though I've only lost money from it (yeah, stupidly.)  


So I think it was 2013 (possibly 2014), I didn't know much about wallets or how it works but I thought 'you know, this could be something and maybe I could find a painless way to get in on the game' so what I landed on was downloading an app and investing just $5 a week into Bitcoin. I did this for a while, and that $5 added up - I didn't really look at the rates (but they were obviously WAY lower than they are now) and I ended up eventually losing interest and actually losing access what I'd brought figuring 'Eh, probably wrong...money doesn't happen that easily.'   


Fast forward to 2017 when the surge happened, and clearly I was kicking myself. I was never in it to be rich, I'm still not. Just to play around and whatever happens happens - but I could have made some money at least...But, i figured 2017 was my shot and I'd let it slip and lost interest again - life remained the same, and I was pretty okay with that.  


Then we had another surge, more recently and I definitely listened. And now I've looked up some stuff and seen people speculating about more massive surges over the next few years.  


Again, I want to do this in a pretty painless way if I do do it, so I'll probably do $5 a week from my pay again - MAYBE $10 since I earn more these days.  


So I guess some questions I have are:  
1. Am I being stupid, did I miss my chance? Like is it probably too late?  
2. From speculation I've read I've formulated the plan to keep buying so long as it's below a certain threshold (which may change, but let's say $150,000) and sell no questions asked if and when Bitcoin reaches my threshold?  
3. Any recommendations for a wallet that trades in Australia? I mean, maybe I'd be smarter if I did something using my email as a log in this time. :/",1625313244,dopey_certification,True,1,3,2021-07-03

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Records Largest Drop in History,"
The Bitcoin blockchain has undergone its biggest ever drop in mining difficulty, as the network‚Äôs automatic stabilizing mechanism kicked in following a strict crackdown by China on the country‚Äôs cryptocurrency industry. 
 
Bitcoin‚Äôs mining difficulty plunged by nearly 28% at block 689,471 at 6:25 UTC. 
 
The adjustment marks the third straight decline in mining difficulty, the first time such a trend has happened since December 2018. On May 29 and June 13, the mining difficulty dropped by 16% and 5%, respectively, according to mining service provider BTC.com. 
 
What is Bitcoin mining difficulty? 
Bitcoin‚Äôs difficulty is measured using an internal score that began at 1 (when Satoshi started mining at the easiest level). It is programmed to increase or decrease incrementally depending on how many miners are competing on the network. It is currently scored at 14,363,025,673,659, down from 19,932,791,027,262. 
 
Blocks are added to the Bitcoin blockchain at a regular and predictable rate: 1 block every 10 minutes or so. Block time measures how long it takes to create a new block, but that pace can vary, depending on the number of miners on the network and the speed of their computers. When there are more miners competing to ‚Äúfind‚Äù the next block, and earn the 6.125 BTC reward, then those blocks tend to be solved more quickly. However, when miners drop off the network, leaving fewer miners to compete, block times can slow down.",1625309038,serhr792,True,1,4,2021-07-03

Bitcoin,The real reason why China banned Bitcoin.,"I hope to analyze the reasons for China‚Äôs Bitcoin-related policies to eliminate FUD against China.

Recently, FUD about China is often discussed in forums. China has successively issued a number of policies to prohibit the use of Bitcoin in China, including banning mining and banning bank card transactions in Bitcoin. Many people think that the reason why China is doing this is the decentralization of Bitcoin that is difficult to regulate, but this is only a small reason.

The biggest reason for China's ban on Bitcoin is carbon neutrality. China‚Äôs carbon strategy roadmap is to achieve carbon peaks before 2030, achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, and even initially achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. According to the Bitcoin Mining Council report on July 1, 2021, 56% of the energy consumed by Bitcoin mining is renewable energy. But in the past in China, although the specific proportion was not announced, the proportion of renewable energy such as hydroelectric power generation must be far smaller than this figure. This is not conducive to China's goal of achieving carbon neutrality. In order to achieve this goal, all industries need to make way for it.

Another important reason is the unprecedented chaos in China's cryptocurrency industry. I believe that if the Chinese people just invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum, the Chinese government will never prohibit the transaction of Bitcoin. Unlike the United States or Australia, many Chinese who invest in cryptocurrency don‚Äôt know what decentralization is, just blindly follow the trend to buy some unknown coins. Chinese investors lack the most basic understanding of the cryptocurrency industry, most people end up in bankruptcy. Only by restricting mining and restricting bank card transactions can China prevent these ordinary people who have been deceived by become parvenu from joining cryptocurrencies. The reason for the Chinese government to create FUD is not to suppress the price of Bitcoin, but to prevent ignorant people from losing money in the cryptocurrency field.

Finally, China's current development focus is still in the manufacturing or infrastructure fields. In China, finance or economy is still a very abstract word for most people. China's overall strength in the financial field lags far behind the developed world. Therefore, the current strategy of the Chinese government is to stabilize the economic foundation first, and after improving the people's knowledge and living standards, it will begin to develop at the financial level. Before that, it is necessary to ensure that China's overall capital flows to the real economy rather than various financial field. 

There are some misunderstandings about China on this forum. I do not comment on the policies of any sovereign country, but in ten years, we may see a China that actively embraces Bitcoin. Although China may still issue policies that have a negative impact on Bitcoin now.",1625293483,serhr792,True,1,7,2021-07-03

Bitcoin,How do you know what code actually runs on any hardware wallet and that it isn't just a rug waiting to be pulled?,"So a company makes a device and posts some open source software. But does that software actually match the software on the device? How would you have any idea? Couldn't they just slip a few lines into that code before shipping them out and not mention those on github? Are there independent reviewers that are somehow able to get a reliable full image and verify it completely?

And do any of the manufacturers publish their electronic schematics? If so do any independent reviewers sit down and test that with voltmeters?

If not verified fully, then I'm concerned that if I get one of these, there's a meaningful chance that it will turn out to have done something like assigning keys based on a known, deterministic RNG progression and that 5 years from now the developers will just crack all the wallets from a resort in Borneo and yoink everything.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin/Lincoln node,"Looking for some advice from experienced node runners. I'm still learning about all of this ie bitcoin and strike.
Quick low down on my plans:
So I have been working towards this for a while now I got the external HDD and enclosure (3tb Hitachi NAS refurbished drive 7200rpm) last week set up and formatted. Today I ordered a mini pc (4gb ram, 64gb ddr memory, roughly 2ghz atom processor if memory serves correctly) my plan is to set up a node to run for about 16hrs overnight to when I'm at work. I'm also considering partitioning the drive two more times to establish a lightning node and link it to my router to work as a network storage and access to a printer because my router is a little off-hand and doesn't have a USB port. Hoping also to see if I can flash the router to a VPN as well for a little added security. 

So question 1 is does all of this seem feasible? Can I get one unit to run a bitcoin and lightning node safely?

For the more tech savvy is this going to be a gopls errand trying to essentially get this unit to operate as a NAS and a node or two?

Bitcoin,What are 3 major problems of Bitcoin‚Ä¶is it time to go for alternatives?,"  Bitcoin, digital currency, became popular in very short span of time due to quick payment options. Dealers of digital currency all over the world welcomed bitcoin with open arms. But with the passage of time some drawbacks were detected in the currency. 3 major flaws were found in the digital currency which damaged the worth of Bitcoin.

[Bitcoin is supposed to be replaced by other crypto currencies](https://preview.redd.it/k8jdiuivew871.jpg?width=275&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2152a649181bb08049c74b29929f505d27452264)",1625274872,abdulrazzaq723,True,1,2,2021-07-03
Bitcoin,"SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said a bitcoin ETF is overdue and argued that its prior rejections for such funds is a kind of double standard. The SEC should have approved a bitcoin ETF a long time ago, she said.","https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/bitcoin-etf-should-be-approved-already-sec-regulator-says.html

&gt; Hester Peirce is perplexed.
&gt; 
&gt; For years, the Securities and Exchange Commission, of which Peirce is a member, has denied applications by the nation‚Äôs exchanges and financial firms to list securities that track the performance of popular digital currency bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; Earlier ‚Äî say, 10 years ago ‚Äî concerns about potential market manipulation and liquidity may have made sense, but things have changed.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúThat is the probably the biggest, the most-often-asked question that I get: When will the SEC approve a bitcoin exchange-traded product?‚Äù Commissioner Peirce said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúI thought that if we had applied our standards as we have applied them to other products, we would already have approved one or more of them,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWith each passing day, the rationale that we have used in the past for not approving seems to grow weaker.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; The SEC applies a ‚Äúunique, heightened standard‚Äù to filings related to digital assets, she wrote in 2020. And she has argued that the agency is asking exchanges and would-be ETF sponsors for assurances beyond what it asks for traditional, equity-based products.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúPeople of a regulatory mindset, when they encounter something new like this, say, ‚ÄòOh, wait a minute: The market for bitcoin looks a bit different than the markets we‚Äôre used to,‚Äô‚Äù Peirce said Thursday.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, she added, the bitcoin market looks more like an established market that has more participation from institutional and mainstream retail investors.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúSo, I think the markets have matured quite a bit,‚Äù Peirce said.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite the currency‚Äôs volatile price swings, Peirce remains convinced that a bitcoin ETF is overdue.
&gt; 
&gt; It‚Äôs not the SEC‚Äôs job to approve or reject applications based on the merits of the investment itself, she said Thursday, especially if exchanges are meeting statutory requirements for protecting investors from fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúBitcoin now is so decentralized. The number of nodes that are involved in Bitcoin is large, and the number of people who have an interest in keeping that work decentralized is very large,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPeople should make their own decisions: If people don‚Äôt want to buy bitcoin because they think it‚Äôs manipulated, they shouldn‚Äôt buy bitcoin.‚Äù",1625274806,simplelifestyle,True,1,18,2021-07-03

I know it looks like facebook, banks, spotify etc. seem like culprits, but they are responding to incentives. Regulations are shaping their business models and reducing competition.

Bitcoin,Won't lost/unrecoverable bitcoin eventually become a problem?,"I'm not trying to FUD here.  It's a legitimate question that I've been thinking about.  I get that less BTC in circulation theoretically makes the remaining BTC more valuable.  But at some point might it erode to the point that there is so little left it would become too rare to become a meaningful currency/store of value.  At some point (if it isn't happening already) there will be more BTC lost than is mined every day.  At that point the math dictates that the supply of BTC will forever trend toward zero.

If BTC becomes adopted by billions of people, that's a lot of opportunity for private keys to be lost/forgotten/taken to the grave every day.

It seems like at some point it would become a problem that has to be addressed.

Bitcoin,Brainstorming: Can Proof-of Stake based coins be more attractive to big states that want to keep control?,"Disclaimer: I am Bitcoin-Only, anything but Bitcoin is garbage to me. This post is just a discussions on a recent thought I had when assessing potential risks for future Bitcoin adoption. I am a very recent Bitcoiner so it is very possible that I'm making a basic logic mistake. Feel free to point that out.

As stated above, I only hold Bitcoin and I am constantly assessing the risks of Bitcoin failing or the Bitcoin adoption not going as I expect in the next 10 years.

As any Bitcoiner I don't believe any other cryptocurrency has any value because they trade-off fundamental values that only Bitcoin has been able to bring to the table (truly decentralised, censorship resistant, proof-of work, etc.). However, I am trying to assess the possibility of a Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrency seeing wider adotption or at least endorsement from big states (US, EU countries, etc), and here is my rationale:

**If Proof-of-Stake is worse at ensuring decentralisation because whoever has the biggest stakes has the biggest power, wouldn't that be attractive for governments who want to keep at leats a certain level of control on the circulating currencies?** For instance, If the US was to use adopt one cryptocurrency as a reserve asset, would they be more attracted to one that they could more easily control (like Ethereum 2.0)?

I am assuming that everything else works properly in Ethereum 2.0 in this case (both technically and economically), which is far from obvious and granted.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Mystery,"I had this really strange occurence with bitcoin. I was looking on an archaic, 2002 type design website about cursed bitcoin addresses. Website was 17year.com but it has since been unregistered. The site had a 23 person queue, which seemed odd for such an old site. I also couldn't find any details on who had registered it or when. I had picked a random address before the shut down: (1EFUPp9gf1kWevhVKvchEdAXk3YQiBtnub, if you're brave enough to mess with it), and sent about 100 quid, 0.0041 Bitcoin, to the address. After about 12 hours, I get an email from an unrecognized address to my main email (not the email associated with my bitcoin address) saying the following:

Dear Mr. M2BT\_1328,

Thank you for your donation to our organization, and your support for our international pursuits is duly noted. We will use these funds to continue our cryptographic activities to bring online privacy to all.

\-17 Year Project.

It had this PGP ID: 7A35090F. What group is this? I know that the chances are low that this is real, and that it could be any old person on the internet trying to troll me, but how did they get my main email address, that I have not associated with any of my subscriptions, least of all bitcoin.

I did some further digging, and found this is a freewallet.io address. Clearly the account holder did not want to give any information to a registered company, so they opted for the opensource alternative. Can anyone do more checks and digging? I really want to know what's going on, and if this is a hoax. If I didn't make a mistake, the PGP is the same as Cicada 3301, and the signature at the end of the email supports that. I have read that in the US, Cicadas swarm every 17 years. Honestly that's as far as I can get since I work as a builder and am not tech savvy .

If I want to follow the ""not your keys; not your coins""-style I would have to essentially run a node myself, because of the way the system with channels and so on is set up, right?

Do you see any way this could change in the future where you could allow for essentially trustless-SPV wallets without this requirement?

Breeze e.g. is non-custodial, but it works by essentially running a node on your phone?  
Now this would be good option, if the wallet itself wouldn't charge you fees on top of it?  
Phoenix is another wallet, but also charges you fees to use it (and requries a huge 10k sat inital deposit?).  
It's similar for muun IIRC.

Wallet of satoshi is of course custodial, but since it doesn't charge you fees it actually seems like the best option for a mobile wallet right now?

Bitcoin,Miner compensation - breakdown.,"I am a bit confused. So the miner (or the pool) who successfully ads a block to Bitcoin is awarded 6.25 new bitcoins, which at today's price (USD 33,270) translates into fiat compensation of USD 207.5k. 

But then there are also transaction fees that senders have to pay to minders. At the moment, average transaction fee is USD 10.61 ([https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin\_average\_transaction\_fee](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee)). Also, at present, each block contains an average of 2,420 transactions. In total, the fees paid by all senders inside the block would be USD 10.61 x 2,420 =USD 25,676.2

So the total comp that a miner (or mining pool) who successfully ads a new block would be: USD 207,500 + USD 25,676.2 = **USD 233,176.2**

Bitcoin,Awesome method to secure your seed phrase.,"Hi folks. We know in crypto world, private key gives anyone the full authority to use the funds. So securing your seed phrase is of utmost importance. Here i suggest a very clean and a secure method to store your seed phrase(which in turn generates your private keys).

1. We need a MacOS computer. Open the Keychain Access program(it is buid-in app on every mac).
2. Click the File menu and choose NEW KEYCHAIN to create a new keychain(it is a file basically). Give it name which will make this file easily recognisable to use even after many years(eg- important file OR bitcoin wallet seed phrase keychain). Create a very very strong password for it consisting of numbers alphabets &amp; special characters.
3. On the upper left corner of the Keychain Access program, you will see your newly created Keychain added to the list of default existing kekychains. Select the newly created keychain. Then go to File menu and choose NEW SECURE NOTE. This will create a secure note item inside this keychain. Give the note a suitable name(eg- my first bitcoin wallet details ETC).
4. Write down the seed phrase in this note. So now, your seed phrase sits in a secure note, which intern in sitting inside a special keychain file which a very strong password.
5. Now, from your Finder, reach your newly created keychain file(it will a .keychain file) and transfer it to a usb drive. Once you have the keychain file on a usb drive, enter the keychain access app and right click your keychain file(in the right upper corner of the app) and select DELETE FILE AND THE REFERENCE. This will delete that keychain file from your mac and it will also dissappear from the keychain access app. So if someone gets to your mac, opens keychain access, he will see only your default keychains. Problem of storing seed phrase in a secure note in the default keychains is that the password for it is the same as your macs logins password(which is mostly a simple password for daily use ease purpose).
6. The vey strong password that you created in step 4, you save it in a secure note in your default keychain. 
7. So if thief gets to your mac, reaches your keychain access and gets your very secure password, he will not get the secure keychain file(which you will be storing in a secure place away from your mac). You can make multiple copies of the secure keychain file and store it in multiple usb drives and store them at multiple places. As no one can open the file without the very secure password, just getting the file will not be useful for the thief. 
8. On a later date, if you feel that your very secure password is compromised somehow, you can open your secure keychain file from the usb drive in other secure imac and change its password.
9. This way, using the keychain access app of macos, we can secure our seed phrase.
10. Please leave your comment if you feel this helpful OR if you find any flaws in this method. Thank you.",1625251472,smartmonty21,True,1,12,2021-07-03

Bitcoin,"I had a psychic premonition dream about bitcoin and other crypto, call me crazy.","I often have that seem to always predict the future, i do psychic work and am I practicing witch. These premonition dreams are not always literal so keep that in mind. My dream was set 10-15 years into the future and i was in an old school but it looked very futuristic but ‚Äútrashy‚Äù it looked kind of like a refugee camp but with holograms and that kind of stuff. I was surrounded by surprised and worried looking students, i introduced myself and told them i was from the year 2021. They believed my and started showing them their phones and other technologies. They showed my a phone which looked kind of like an old nokia 3310 but with colored oled display and where the rubber silicone buttons are on the old nokia there were screens little oval screens that could turn into emojis letters and numbers etc.

On the larger screen on the phone at the too i saw a little logo that displayed a symbol that looked like alien currency, i asked what‚Äôs that? They told me it‚Äôs their wallet app. I immediately understood it was a crypto wallet and asked about which cryptos were most valuable. They told me bitcoin, but that they used safemoon and the other part of town used dogecoin. 
They explained that they were ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù teens and young adults who fled their homes and larges city‚Äôs because they didn‚Äôt have any freedom and we‚Äôre being used for their blood? I don‚Äôt know either‚Ä¶

These refugee communities all used different crypto‚Äôs in what they called a hub. A hub consisted of different communities that all used different currencies and had different rules with their own smart contracts. They also told me that ethereum and bitcoin were the main world wide currency and ethereum smart contracts held all laws and were used to sell anything from insurance to houses. 
Whenever the refugees traveled to mayor cities they exchange their crypto for bitcoin or ethereum at these kind of gates with terminals they inserted their phone devices into to be let into the city. They put their arm into these terminals and get pricked with vaccinations. 

They also told me Bitcoin and ethereum became centralized by mainly china and the usa and the European Union. They held all validators and banned anyone else from mining. Ethereum 2.0 was banned and cancelled and all other proof of stake tokens were used by what they called free minds, refugees and people outside of mayor cities. The world seemed really deviced.

Once school was out they took me to a mayor city and we went out to eat, they now explained that only in large companies and city‚Äôs they used bitcoin and ethereum. In all other cities and towns they used altcoins like ada dogecoin shiba and safemoon. If you wanted to get into a large city you would have to have bitcoin and get vaccinated at automated machine terminals. We got our food from a large vending type machine the size of a wall and we payed jn bitcoin. But they didnt show it as for example 0.000005 but it looked like this. (5)5 BTC, we ate are food and went to a market to buy some items. They were long streets with a lot of virtual screens showing all kinds of adverts.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin transaction fees high again...Making it unusable for day-to-day use...,"Bitcoin transaction fee is hovering at 80 sat/byte which is about $10 for a normal-sized transaction. This is making bitcoin extremely unfriendly to use for day-to-day transactions that average at about $10-$50, paying a $10 fee for such transactions is absolutely ridiculous. 

Even though it is lower than the ridonculous $60 fee BTC saw back in April during the ATH, it still is pretty useless.  

That problem has been bought up multiple times but nothing seems to be the solution. I am aware of the Chinese crackdown on miners and upcoming difficulty adjustment but daily use cannot be put on hold and if such external factors affect bitcoin fees every time then the developers need to acknowledge the problem and find a solution. 

I have tried everything to [speed up the transaction](https://blog.blockonomics.co/how-to-speed-up-bitcoin-transactions-4ca4159991ab) but nothing seems to be working other than paying the $10 fee.

Bitcoin,I want to talk about Soros and Bitcoin.,"
I think we need to think about this problem from two aspects.

From a long-term perspective, Soros is quite tiny in front of Bitcoin. He cannot change the work of the blockchain or manipulate the price of Bitcoin forever.

In the short term, it is interesting to analyze this emergency.

In 1997, Thailand's GDP was 150.2 billion U.S. dollars. Almost everyone knows that Soros destroyed the price of the Thai baht by various ways. In other words, in 1997, Soros's money could affect an economy of US$150.2 billion. In 2020, Thailand‚Äôs GDP is about 500 billion U.S. dollars, so can Soros probably affect an economy of about 500 billion U.S. dollars? No matter what the answer isÔºåbitcoin's current market value is about 4 trillion U.S. dollars, which seems to be much higher than the price Soros can influence. 

On the other hand, does Soros own Bitcoin? After experiencing a rapid increase in the first half of the year, the price of Bitcoin once exceeded $60,000, but now it is only $30,000. For Soros, this is a good time to buy Bitcoin. At present, many celebrities are optimistic that Bitcoin will break new highs at the end of the year or early next year. Buying Bitcoin at this time is a good choice.

This sounds very logical, but we all know that Soros is an investment master. Maybe he bought Bitcoin a long time ago, and this time just want to use his influence to push the price of Bitcoin to sell again. After all, as I mentioned earlier, many people will think that Soros will choose to buy Bitcoin at this point in time.

I prefer the first of these two possibilities. With Elon Musk as a precedent, Soros should realize that just tweeting or releasing news can no longer affect the price of Bitcoin in a large range. And I also think that Soros, as an old-school financial player, needs to take a certain amount of time to accept Bitcoin. It is unlikely to buy Bitcoin at a very low price before then choose to sell it at this short-term low Bitcoin price. And I think based on Soros‚Äôs knowledge of the financial market, if he chooses to sell Bitcoin, he will definitely be close to the high point of the Bitcoin price instead of now.

The conclusion is that I think Soros has discovered the potential of the cryptocurrency market and is ready to study how to buy it.

I have been googling this for a while but the Bitcoin scanners I am finding (like [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com)) don't seem to have the functionality to view the top wallets. At least not that I can see. 

I have read that Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first 1,000,000 bitcoins and never spent them. That they are all still in his wallet since 2009. I just wondered if there was a way to see this for myself.

Bitcoin,Sold my first Bitcoin and am happy,"
Just sold 5% of my Bitcoin that I've been holding for 3 years and I feel satisfied doing so.

I didn't need to sell, and it was mainly for the satisfaction of getting back some of my original investment.

However, I also feel like its broken the ""HODL AT ALL COSTS"" mindset which I felt was getting a bit unhealthy.

I do feel there are risks with Bitcoin, and I won't drag people down with that here, but I will be diversifying that money into gold and shares, mainly tech shares.

If Bitcoin dips a lot, I will also buy some more Bitcoin though.

Basically, I'm glad I sold some if only to stop feeling like a slave to it (and to test the Coinbase selling functionality which only took seconds for the transaction).",1625237643,serhr792,True,1,19,2021-07-02

Bitcoin,"On the 4th of July Bitcoin's difficulty is to get reset, and will be free of China mining - Oddly fitting.","I don't know if this is deserving as a stand alone post, but what the fuck, no one could have planned it better.

For those that don't know, Bitcoin block rate is currently running 1 per 20 mins, vs 10 mins, and is set for an extreme difficulty adjustment (to speed them up).

This will make miners more profitable, benefiting those who live in more free and equitable societies than China.

As miners become more profitable, they either sell less coin (put them on permanent hodl, as Michael Saylor suggests), or they expand ops. Either way, this generally is expected to lead to greater price stability.

Miners outside of China have been found to be using 56% renewable energy, per the report by Michael Saylor. As most countries favor new green energy alternatives, Bitcoin is set to continue expanding it's lead as the most green energy industry in the world, that's not exclusively focused on green energy.

Can anyone name a single industry that's more than 50% renewable? Outside of solar, wind, and geo farms etc.? I don't think so.

Even Tesla cars are dependent upon grid power, which in most parts of the world is less than 20% renewable, unless they come attached with a $50k solar / battery project (doubling the cost).

So all in all - on July 4th - more Bitcoins will be moved into the freer societies than was done in the past. More Bitcoins will be mined with more sustainable, less pollutant energy, than was done in the past. Bitcoin will excel as one of the greatest stimulants of computer technology and energy efficiency optimization, including expanded use of flair gas and volcano technology, optimizing energy output in remote locations and super energization, to maximize global efficiencies.

&gt; Super energization is a renewable issue, where one needs double the solar production vs coal, as solar must be stored, but coal is naturally 'batteried' and can be turned off / on with demand - all renewables require hyper production, to account for the lack of ability to adjust output with demand - necessitating massive battery production or sustainable storage, which is accomplished with Bitcoin.

So, while the market may be rocky - the start of the next cycle of Bitcoin is tops. Hold strong, and rotate assets from those that are peaking, to those that are robust.

The roots are deep, and Bitcoin is a mighty power.

Bitcoin,Bought my vitamins with Bitcoin,"
For several years, I have been maintaining my overall well-being by taking US-made vitamins with the same brand since late 2013. I usually order them both offline and online, either paying it through cash, bank transfer or debit card. Until now, I am still a proud user of it. It really helped managed my anxiety and panic attack symptoms, as well as better sleep quality, extra stamina during the day, better metabolism, etc. 

But I stopped ordering online for 2 years. In order to save me some shipping fees, I have decided to order it from a good friend who is a licensed distributor of the vitamins product. 

One day, I realized that my stocks are almost running out. So I called him to meet me to get my vitamins. My friend already have a Bitcoin wallet, but never really used it. So I asked him if he liked to be paid by Bitcoin this time, and he eventually said yes.

So I just scanned his QR code and paid him the amount (there was zero fee because of using the same wallet). And there you have it, my first Bitcoin peer to peer transaction with my friend for the vitamins.

My good friend is happy, and he doesn‚Äôt mind me to use Bitcoin again to transact with him. I don‚Äôt mind how long will BTC be massively adopted, at least it‚Äôs good to spread awareness and advocacy about it.",1625235297,sverlinas2,True,1,9,2021-07-02

Bitcoin,The fungibility of Bitcoin ‚Äî Long Term,"
The fungibility of Bitcoin is a serious topic that requires discussion. I hope we all agree that having our transactions publicly announced won't make ours coins fungible. Truth be told, our beloved Bitcoin can't work same like as cash, because cash doesn't leave footprints. A dollar is equal with a dollar no matter who transacted it with who. On the contrary, a block chain analysis may be enough to prove that my inputs have a connection with a criminal activity and be censored for that. Recently, I read that despite the mixing and the coinjoining, there are centralized services that will decline ‚Äútainted‚Äù bitcoins.

It then comes to my mind that once there will be really less bitcoins left to be mined, like two decades later, the miners will have a better income from the transaction fees instead. Right now, every 10 minutes, 6.25 freshly mined and ‚Äúwhitelisted‚Äù bitcoins are brought into circulation. But, after we've mined most of them, we'll use the already mined bitcoins for our transactions.

If that's true, then the system will be filled with ‚Äútainted‚Äù bitcoins in the long term, as there'll always be criminal activity. Your thoughts.",1625224658,VeronZ76,True,1,13,2021-07-02

Bitcoin,My feelings after 11 years with crypto.,"
Hello everyone, today i want to tell you about my crypto-depression. 
So in 2010 i was working in IT company and my friend from work told me about bitcoin mining. 
Next day after this information i register on this forum and start mining coins, everything going perfect but bitcoin price was really low and unstable. 
I was investing everything in gpu. Couple times i lost my fund's on scam-exchange but i still had a lot of ""mining power"".
In 2015 i quited my job and invest my whole savings in bitcoin, in that time i had more than 15 bitcoin's and gpu worth 20k$.
And after 2 or 3 week's everything fucked up, in same time i lost my job and my wife get sicked.

Bitcoin,Mixing your Bitcoin might become illegal in the future,"
The recent popularity of Bitcoin has brought the attention of governments and central banks worldwide. We've seen certain opposition from countries like India, China, and Russia against the pioneer cryptocurrency. Countries that are friendly towards Bitcoin (like the US and UK), are constantly surveilling its citizens for any suspicious activity. I've seen that some countries have taken action against Bitcoin mixing services with the excuse that they're used for money laundering and terrorist financing. Since most (if not all) of these centralized mixers don't comply with KYC/AML regulations, they're subject to being shut down by the government. Imagine if criminals begin using Bitcoin mixers in mass for money laundering purposes. If the trend continues, mixing Bitcoin may turn out to become illegal.

Do you think there's a possibility this will happen in the future? If not, why? What do you think will happen once mixers (both custodial and non-custodial) are banned by the government? Will this force people to use privacy coins more thoroughly? Or will everything remain the same? Any input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance",1625217234,VeronZ76,True,1,18,2021-07-02

Bitcoin,Is this Wyckoff guy correct with this? Dude is a real OG if so," **Note:** ***Springs or shakeouts*** *usually occur late within a TR and allow the stock‚Äôs dominant players to make a definitive test of available supply before a markup campaign unfolds. A ‚Äúspring‚Äù takes price below the low of the TR and then reverses to close within the TR; this action allows large interests to mislead the public about the future trend direction and to acquire additional shares at bargain prices. A terminal shakeout at the end of an accumulation TR is like a spring on steroids. Shakeouts may also occur once a price advance has started, with rapid downward movement intended to induce retail traders and investors in long positions to sell their shares to large operators. However, springs and terminal shakeouts are not required elements: Accumulation Schematic 1 depicts a spring, while Accumulation Schematic 2 shows a TR without a spring.*

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Not User Friendly Yet,"
Hello everyone. For all of us who are very pro Bitcoin and other crypto.
We all look to the day that more people use it and accept it as daily use.

However we are far from that. One thing that I am finding is Bitcoin is still not user friendly enough.
Many people even who are young like 25 and under and even over 25 etc. Are not tech knowledge or financial educated enough to understand.

I am thinking that even the apps out there are still confusing for people to use.
Sure many people may own a mobile phone but many do not understand how they work.

Therefore many people do not understand Bitcoin and seems too complicated still.

What are 5 things you think are needed to make Bitcoin more easy for people to use?

More less they can use and move Bitcoin without really being mindful of what they are doing in a transaction.

I know about crypto and everything in general but I am having difficulty to understand one thing about it. Why crypto or bitcoin is better than money ?

I mean I know the block chain technology is revolutionary and it has many benefits, it is being used by all crypto. Money is used to buy goods and services and there are very less businesses accepting crypto and still the prices are rocket High.

This Crypto trend looks more like share market company evaluation rather a legitimate currency. Moreover all government have there own currency, goverment cannot let that sink and can ban these.

Bitcoin,I would like to give some encouragement to folks who have converted their first value into Bitcoin in the last 7 weeks and feel like they are down,"You think you fucked up. ‚ÄòOmg, I bought at 60k, and I‚Äôm still holding. I‚Äôm questioning my once staunch conviction‚Ä¶‚Äô 

Let me tell you something that you already know but that you need to hear again: you‚Äôre surprisingly one of the smartest human beings on the planet.

I bought my first BTC in 2014 for $400 and sold it for $500 in 2016, thinking I was a shrewd investor. I was wrong. 

In fact, I was a frustrated investor, thinking that my $400 investment should‚Äôve made much, much more in my speculative investment I had made. Afterall, I was taking on a lot of risk and I‚Äôve held for 2 years without much return, right?‚Ä¶

About a month after I sold my $500 BTC I was scrambling to buy as much $2k BTC as 
I could. Oops, now it‚Äôs 5 years later and that $500 BTC would be worth $36k. 

I‚Äôve done well, despite not trading perfectly. You know what I‚Äôve done. I‚Äôve bought more and more all the way up and all the way down since my first market disappointment. Cycle after cycle after cycle.

And you know what? My net worth is way bigger than my Dads. 

The lesson is: you can‚Äôt fuck it up. You‚Äôre an early adopter, still. Buy BTC, it‚Äôs the greatest technological innovation of your lifetime. It could take years to get even, but you‚Äôre gonna be okay. 

I‚Äôm not shit.
I heard this same thing from real OGs who bought in 2013, and THEY weren‚Äôt shit compared to guys in 2010.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin DCA - The largest charitable movement in human history,"Just wanted to share what is admittedly a very long, but i think very powerful, quote from Hass McCook (@FriarHass):

\&gt;""I view bitcoin for what it actually is - the largest charitable movmement in human history. It literally fixes everything. You care about the whales? Not the financial whales - the mammals, the ones in the sea? Well, you donate to Greenpeace or whatever. You want to save the kids? You donate to like the kids charity. But, if you want to just save everything in one fell swoop, who do you donate to? You just donate to bitcoin.  
\&gt;It's one of the very few charities you can donate to who don't take custody of donations, completely decentralised, you get wealthy for donating and you fix the world. Like it's an extremely beautiful thing

\&gt;I like to say I hate saying money is wasted on charities because good charity is never a waste, but the literature shows that at least 40% of money donated to charity goes to overhead. So it's just wasted.

\&gt;The market will allocate capital efficiently. You have a look at how good charity will be once bitcoiners are properly rich for example. The main priority, and I know it's hard and I sound very heartless, but the kids have been starving for 50 years. So you've gotta just, i'm sorry, they've just gotta starve for 5 more years, you focus on bitcoin and bitcoin only and I promise you they won't starve anymore. That's all i'm trying ot say, we're giving moeny and still not fixing the problem and the problems only getting worse. The problem is structural and we're doing symptomatic treatment. Unless the fiat system goes, no charity can be 100% effective

Bitcoin,question: are people who held BTC at the time of the bitcash fork entitled to some bitcash ?,"as I understand it, the bitcash cryptocurrency was created by a hard fork from BTC in 2017 (since then it had a similar fork of its own but that's not relevant I presume)

now several sources I've encountered state that anyone who held BTC at the time of the fork came into possession of bitcash  'as if from an airdrop' (quote).

now I may be wrong here but that does not sound like BTC holders at the time of the fork had to choose between keeping their BTC holding and receiving equivalent holding in bitcash. rather, it sounds like BTC holders at the time received bitcash holdings on top of their BTC holding at no addition cost. is that what happent? and if so, was it a one time thing which people had to apply for or can anyone who held BTC at the time of the fork still claim some bitcash?

Bitcoin,Due Diligence on BTC Trading Bot," 

I started trading Bitcoin a month ago I came across a ""trading bot"" ([authenticbot.com](https://authenticbot.com)) that seemed to have promising results so I decided to give it a try. The results since then have been‚Ä¶remarkable. I'm not an employee, just a fan so here's my write up.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS A TRADING BOT AND HOW DOES IT WORK?

Crypto markets are open all the time and don't close. AuthenticBot is a fully automated bot, that trades on your behalf 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week. It was created by a couple of clever developers in Germany. They've been working on it for a year, and finally made it publicly available in Feb 2021.

AB uses a set of indicators to look for likely points of Bitcoin price reversals. It will determine trade bias, trade amount, entry point and exit point. It will then long/short BTC futures using small amounts and dollar cost average until the exit point is reached. The bot will never leverage more then 10% of your account, and most of the time only bets 1%.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT EXCHANGE DOES IT USE?

The bot uses the ByBit exchange that allows you to trade futures contracts on BTC. ByBit does NOT support all countries, and will filter out IP addresses coming those countries. For instance, the US is one of the handful of countries NOT supported, but most other countries (ex: Canada) are supported. Beyond an IP check, they don't check for anything else‚Ä¶**so some people will use VPNs to fund their bybit account.**

There's a lots of videos on what bybit is and how to trade on it, here are a couple:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/90d6vb7fvn871.png?width=633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=047141e815bcbbab9944801c86040c0a65b22780

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2mbihq5gvn871.png?width=627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e91543f3a258cc8bc9f9e637b2f330cbef8992fd

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

ARE MY FUNDS SAFE?

The first question is if the funds are safe from the bot owners? As an account owner, you would grant the bot API permissions to ONLY perform trades on your behalf. The bot would NOT have permissions to do withdrawals, only do trades.

The next question is are the funds safe on ByBit exchange? Any hot wallet is less safe then a cold wallet, and ByBit is likely no exception. ByBit is also not FDIC insured. So if you're accustomed to trading traditional securities on Etrade, this may not be for you. The bot needs access to your BTC to make trades with it, so having funds in a hot wallet is a risk if you want to trade BTC. There's lots of articles on ByBit exchange platform security, so I would recommend doing your own DD here. AB is definitely aimed for folks who are already trading crypto on exchanges like Coinbase, etc.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

SO‚Ä¶HOW HAS THE BOT PERFORMED?

When you setup the bot, they will create twitch stream where you can monitor your bots trades. The initial bot account ([https://www.twitch.tv/authenticbot44](https://www.twitch.tv/authenticbot44)) was created in Feb 2021 and seeded with 0.30393405 BTC ($10k USD at the time). As of today, it has 0.79744405 BTC ($26.2k USD)‚Ä¶for an increase of +162% BTC over 5 months!!

When I first looked at this, I thought it couldn't be true. So I looked at the trades since beginning of May 2021 when BTC was near 60k (it has crashed 40% in that time frame). Over that last 40 days, the bot has made 177 trades.

Keep in mind, 20% increase in BTC does NOT mean your account increased by 20% in USD. If BTC drops by an amount greater then 20% per month, a 20% increase in BTC likely means your account is close to break even. However if BTC can remain stable or increases, then your USD value will increase with the BTC growth.

As a day trader, I only make profits M-F. What I like about AuthenticBot is that it's trading for my 24/7. When I wake up, it's usually made a profit‚Ä¶sometimes small, sometimes big.

\- 165 trades were profitable (93%) vs 12 trades for losses (7%)

\- Average trade size was only 1.47% of the account

\- Average profit per trade was 0.00539 BTC (or $180 at $36k BTC/USD)

\- Average loss per trade was 0.0001183 (or $3.60 at $36k BTC/USD)

\- Average win:loss dollar ratio is almost 50:1.

\- **Average ROI over this 40d period was +0.69% BTC per day, or +20.7% per month (net of bot fees)**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW MUCH DO THEY CHARGE?

AB owners charge a fee based on monthly profits, so if you make BTC then they make BTC. They charge 30% of the profits they earned on your behalf. Yes it's a chunk, but you're not paying anything out of pocket. If they only earn a little, you pay a little. If they earn you a lot, then you pay more. **However, if you don't make any profits for the month, then they don't you charge anything and it's FREE.** So if they break even or lose BTC, then they worked for free for a month and you pay nothing. It's a shared risk model. They also have a minimum balance to start a new account. When they first started it was $10k USD, it's now $20k USD.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW DO I LEARN MORE?

They have a website ([authenticbot.com](https://authenticbot.com/)) but they primarily engage with users and interested folks via a discord server and operate mostly on word of mouth. If you're interested and are ok with the account minimum balance/fees, contact them via [authenticbot.com](https://authenticbot.com/) and they'll send you the discord link. You can join the discord server, ask questions and do your own due diligence. Again, costs absolutely nothing unless they make you a profit.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

TLDR

\- Fully automated bot that trades on your behalf 24/7, created by some guys in Germany

\- Bot trades on bybit exchange, buying/selling BTC futures contracts leveraging up to 10% of account

\- Over past 40 day period, it has averaged 0.69% per day or 20.7% per month (net profit)

\- Initial bot account seeded with $10k USD (in February 2021) with no additional funding now at $27k USD

\- Bot charges 30% of net profit - so you're only charged if it makes you a profit, $20k USD account minimum",1625171544,brucehuy,True,1,0,2021-07-02

Bitcoin,Tips for new crypto investors,"1. Ignore the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù

Many naysayers in the media and financial sectors may preach that cryptocurrency is simply a fad, over-hyped speculation, or even a pyramid scheme. On the other hand, a growing population increasingly embraces the financial prospects and practical applications of cryptocurrency assets. Both sides have loud voices and like to make a lot of noise.

This noise level is only expected to increase, as Satis Group predicted; To be a successful investor in this space, it is best to just buy and hold what you believe in (see tip 4!) while ignoring all the noise around you.

2. Expect the unexpected

However, significant volatility does exist in cryptocurrency markets which cannot be ignored. Experienced cryptocurrency investors are accustomed to huge price swings that you often don‚Äôt find in traditional markets. By mentally preparing for these unfavorable, and occasionally terrifying, investment performances, the intelligent crypto investor will be able to act rationally instead of emotionally in times of unexpected price drops.

3. Avoid a bad trade or investment strategy

A common mistake for beginner cryptocurrency investors is joining what is known as a ‚Äúpump and dump group‚Äù Certain social media communities or ‚Äògurus‚Äô may even promise investment tips regarding a particular coin. You should avoid these types of places at all costs; when travelers go down these roads, they don‚Äôt often come back.

The problem is that since derivatives trading is a zero-sum game, there is always a winner, but more importantly a loser. Unless a solid trading or investment strategy is in place, heedlessly following such advice is the fast track to losing your money to modern-day snake oil salesmen.

4. Perform your due diligence

In this modern digital age, there is even wifi on the path to crypto investing enlightenment, hence there is no excuse to make an investment with little to no understanding of the underlying asset. Almost every single coin has easily accessible whitepapers online. And just like having maps in the car, the savvy traveler must be prepared.

From the heavily traded to the most niche, resources such as the All Crypto Whitepapers will help any individual brush up their knowledge on potential future investments. If it is impossible to tell how the coin operates and more importantly, makes money, then it would be wise to seek another investment opportunity. From the biggest initial coin offerings (ICOs) to the most niche altcoins, this site will have you covered.

5. Don‚Äôt place all your crypto-coins in one basket

Common investment wisdom prevails when it comes to cryptocurrency investment: diversification is key. Just as financial advisors recommend taking positions in multiple types of stocks and other investments, diversification is also essential for any healthy cryptocurrency portfolio.

You‚Äôve done your research, so now seize the opportunity to invest in multiple coins. As one example, you can invest across different sectors which serve different use cases. Just like it‚Äôs always safer to travel as a group then as a single person when you‚Äôre in unfamiliar territory, establishing a diversified portfolio will help you along your path toward realizing potential future cryptocurrency gains.

6. Opt for an alternative personal email

Using a regular email account places an investor at an unnecessary risk of exposure for a data breach. To overcome this risk, it is recommended to create a unique account just for trading, especially with added two-factor authentication password security. No matter what, ensure that two-factor authentication is utilized for every service that offers it (for example both your email account and your exchange account should require two-factor authorization to access). Likewise, make sure to use a dedicated two-factor application (such as Google authenticator, or Authy) as opposed to using text messages for two-factor authorization (these are susceptible to social engineering hacks).

Additionally, when setting up your accounts, be sure to select a unique username and password that has no personally identifiable information that would-be hackers could trace back to you.

7. Understand the uses for both cold and hot wallets

Cryptocurrency can be stored via an offline ‚Äúcold‚Äù wallet or an online ‚Äúhot‚Äù wallet. Ease of access makes hot wallets a more desirable option for the beginner investor. However, as convenient as hot wallets are, they are susceptible to being hacked, whereas cold wallets are not able to be hacked (if prepared properly). Ideally, it‚Äôs best to store cryptocurrency you plan on saving for a long time in a cold wallet, and keep only a small amount that you might use on a daily basis in a hot wallet.

Additionally, one common mistake made by many new investors is mistaking exchanges for wallets. Although it might seem convenient keeping everything online at an exchange, a common mantra you might hear others chanting goes like ‚Äòif you don‚Äôt own your keys, then you don‚Äôt own your bitcoin‚Äô. And when you keep your digital assets on exchanges, you don‚Äôt own the keys. This can become important when exchanges go down, get hacked. Take the time to research different wallet providers. There are lots of great options available today.

8. Remain careful around mobile wallets

Trading or storing large sums of any cryptocurrency via mobile phone is simply too great a risk. Mobile phones are more prone to being compromised electronically or physically. Although convenient, convenience should not surpass the security concerns that abound with executing trades or storing assets on mobile devices.

Hopefully, these eight tips will help give you solid footing on the road toward crypto-investing. Looking for more tips.",1625165692,Linda_Clore,True,1,0,2021-07-02

Halving Year: 2012, 2016, 2020
Bullish Year: 2013, 2017, 2021
Bearish Year: 2014, 2018

1st Take: Year 2013 and 2017 have only 3 months are red and 9 month are green. In 2021 we all ready saw 3 month red, now next 6 month can be green as per bull cycle.

2nd Take: In last 10 years, Whenever June close with red candle , July gave jump of of 18%-24%. So if July 2021 follow same , we will see target of near $42k as per average 20% growth.

3rd Take: In 2021,month jump is opposite of last 10 years trend. Examples are:
-Out of 10 times, March give 2 green and 8 red months in last 10 years. But in 2021 March gave 30% jump that was opposite of Trend.
-Same April and May month have bullish cycles in last 10 years, but both month was red in 2021. As per this August and September can be bullish month for bitcoin in 2021.",1625164835,Zalkifl_Savage,True,1,6,2021-07-02

Bitcoin,Regarding Yesterday's Congressional Hearing with Coincenter's Testimony,"I feel like the single missing part of regulatory talk in the united states on crypto is that no one understands that a unified clearing exchange for digital asset commodities will have to be built and the Token taxonomy act, and Digital Commodity act passed. 

&amp;#x200B;

CME can't work with blockchain. LedgerX and coinbase built the full financial stack. Traditional finance does not do this. Trad fi uses common clearing exchanges, prime brokers etc. It's economically unfeasible and untenable to expect every crypto service to build a full stack.  

&amp;#x200B;

 The obsession crypto people have with the SEC is misplaced. Bitcoin is a commodity. There has to be common backends that allow systemic risk monitoring and public data. That's how tradfi works, and US gov won't allow any other way. This is nonnegotiable for having a domestic market that institutions use. Right now all major institutions do significant derivative related things offshore. 

&amp;#x200B;

This can't and wont last based on what the DoJ wants. You may not like the direction things are going, but this is necessary to mainstream adoption. Crypto is overwhelmed with fraud as it is. It's a net detriment to long term adoption.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Re the mods-- You should not censor traders and legal researchers because you disagree with the government and hate futures. 

The mods here need to realize that being adversarial to regulatory talk is a zero sum affair. If you don't advocate for changes that allow modern institutions to participate we will not get mainstream hyperbitcoinization.

Energy inefficiency is locked to each system. Let‚Äôs imagine a solar farm in space connected to a mining rig and a computer on earth that needs power. Rather than sending a high power microwave from one to the next we can send energy through low power data transmission.

Bitcoin creates an energy gradient in time &amp; space.

Bitcoin,Bitcoiners Obsessed With Price Action &amp; Decrying FUD,"Quick sound off about some observations:

1. There are way too many in this sub that are obsessed with short-term price action. It's like being in a room full of addicts.

2. This sub's culture tends to reinforce the above. 

3. This sub includes too many people that say they're advocates of free markets, yet decy institutions that stir up FUD to essentially buy at discounts. Spoiler alert: that's exactly what a rational free market actor with such abilities *should* do. The hypocrisy annoys.

That's all I got. The more I engage with this sub, the more I cringe at it. I keep coming back because something like 2 out of 10 posts are informative with great participation from knowledgeable people. The rest are, in one way or another, demonstrating this obsession with the exchange rate and/or their daily frustrations about why 'number go up technology no work.'

Bitcoin,Not FUD but want honest answers. Should we be worried about Tether?,"First let me say I have been invested in BTC for about a year and I hold a considerable amount. I believe in crypto and the blockchain. And I do my research. 

So I have been researching Tether since I like to check out contrary opinions to make sure I‚Äôm not self-validating myself (usually checking out the nocoiners at r/buttcoin) 

There they mentioned that Tether is not backed by USD. I read up on Tether and it seems that for the past 3 years they have come under a lot of pressure to be audited and had some recent legal troubles since something like &lt;5% of Tether is backed by cash and ~70% is backed by commercial paper. 

There was also a claim that Tether is artificially pumping up BTC by making huge wash trades. This I don‚Äôt understand and would like to hear your opinions on. 

Lastly the market cap for Tether seems to be increasing still and if you check out r/tether it is a desert. No one is there and a lot of bots post. 

So what do you think? I heard a lot of opinions about how Tether is going to destroy crypto but I don‚Äôt buy that right now. But to be honest I don‚Äôt have a compelling reason except that people will believe in crypto. 

What‚Äôs going to happen with Tether and how will that affect BTC? If it will affect it.

Bitcoin,The principle of mining is introduced,"Bitcoin mining is the process of confirming transactions that have taken place in the Bitcoin system over a period of time and recording them on the blockchain to form a new block. The miners are called miners.

To put it simply, mining is the process of keeping accounts, miners are the bookkeepers, and blockchain is the ledger.How do you motivate miners to dig?The billing power of the Bitcoin system is decentralized, meaning that each miner has the right to keep the books.

Miners who managed to grab the bookkeeping rights were rewarded with new Bitcoins in the system.So mining is the process of producing bitcoins.Satoshi Nakamoto originally designed Bitcoin to provide that every 210,000 blocks produced, Bitcoin reward halved once, until Bitcoin can no longer be subdivided.Because bitcoin, like gold, has a finite amount of it.That's why bitcoin is called digital gold, and bitcoin production is also known as mining.

Mining, technically, is the process of random collisions in computer hashes (hash or hash functions).To put it simply, the Bitcoin system sets out a mathematical problem to see who can solve the mining equipment first.

Colored computers, led by the miners, began to calculate the correct answers.The Bitcoin system itself also adjusts the difficulty, controlling the time it takes to solve the problem, and typically mines a block every 10 minutes or so.During those 10 minutes, the computer just keeps calculating and trying out strings.

Until you first try out the only correct answer:

""Bitcoin"" (actually, it's not that simple), which corresponds to the exact same hash value as in the title. In this case, you write ""Bitcoin"" into a block and wait for the system to issue bitcoin rewards (50 in 2009).

Halve the reward every four years) and TIPS fees for all transactions within this block.

It is also a competition between different kinds of computing power, or computing power for short.

Miners with more powerful computers/mining machines made more money.

While mining is a probabilistic event, a miner with more computing power may not always be the fastest to find a positive solution, proportionally speaking, if the miner has 10% computing power, he will probably find 10 blocks out of 100.

Ordinary people can get into Bitcoin in one of two ways: by investing in the secondary market, or by buying a mining machine and digging it themselves

All commodities have a source of production. Gold is mined, apples are planted, and bitcoin is produced by miners.

Unlike other physical goods, Bitcoin is acquired online.

People compete with each other to solve an extremely complex math problem on the Internet, and the first person to complete it is rewarded in the form of bitcoins.

In the early days of bitcoin in 2009, bitcoin mining was done on a personal computer, using the CPU to compute math problems.

But as the number of people involved in mining increased, the difficulty of mining bitcoin was adjusted, and it became more and more difficult for people to mine bitcoin with the CPU, so the bitcoin mining machine appeared.

As the name suggests, this is a machine specifically designed to mine bitcoin, which is characterized by high computational power and high mining efficiency.

So you don't have to do it in your head anymore, you have to do it on a calculator.

Other people have a few computers in the exam. Can you still win by calculating by mouth?

Of course not.

So mining machines are now the standard allocation for Bitcoin miners. Small miners are those with fewer mining machines, and big miners are those with strong financial strength.",1625145862,No-Result-2929,True,1,6,2021-07-01

100 comment karma, no posts. 90% of the comments in one of those subs where people beg for karma so they can post on normal subs. The other comments were interesting thou. They were on crypto subs and they promoted some ""big shot investor"" they had made money investing with - guaranteed returns of course.

The funny thing is they were responding to their own comments from different accounts having a conversation with themselves about how great said guy is and giving each other (themselves) tips on investment.

How do I know it's the same person you may ask? Well funny enough they used the same account description on all their accounts, all are online at the same time and only comment at the same time, all on the same subs first begging for karma and then promoting a crypto scam talking to themselves.

If an attacker were to gain 51% of hash power, they could spend BTC, wait until the vendor delivered the purchased product (e.g. fiat), and then use their excess hash power to produce a revised block history without their BTC spend in it.

Say nodes agreed on a block revision limit, say, 6. This would mean that if they see an incoming chain that is longer than the previous longest chain they have seen, they would reject it if it involved changes in blocks further back than 6 blocks ago.

If vendors then required 6 confirmations before delivering purchased product, they could be sure that the consensus chain will not be revised to double spend the BTC used to purchase that product.

Bitcoin,Is Bitcoin truly a safe-haven asset?,"
Bitcoin evangelist has always attributed Bitcoin to be a safe-haven asset, while extreme fanatics believe that Bitcoin is far better than gold. Bitcoin was born in the wake of the 2008 financial crash as a libertarian currency and as an instrument that could help cushion the event of a future financial crisis. 

Since Bitcoin is purely a speculative risk asset, many people have doubted its position as a purported safe-haven asset, I am not one of them anyways. However, since Bitcoin hasn't witnessed a global recession yet, I feel Bitcoin hasn't sufficiently defended its narrative as a safe-haven asset. 

As the possibility of a global recession intensifies, what's your take on the possible performance of Bitcoin? will it go down with the traditional market or will it defend its name? I am very much interested to know.",1625121235,dinkh7,True,1,9,2021-07-01

Bitcoin,A 3-fold question on compressed addresses,"Hi there, I recently got into managing my own keys and have some questions regarding the compressed versions of public keys (and therefore private keys).

1) So to test it out I made a paper wallet using a generator website. I sent a very low amount to my compressed address and then to my uncompressed address. I expected when I explore the blockchain either address of the two will show both amounts. My logic here was that both addresses lead to the same place but I quickly found out that each address displayed it's own balance. This is my first question - what's the point even of these compressed addresses? I know about how each transaction should be under a brand new address but that's kind of another thing. Is the compression really just so that there are more addresses out there and there is no random address collision - I don't get it.

2) So I also found that my private key doesn't work with both addresses (compressed and uncompressed) and I had to use a compressed priv key for my compressed address and uncompressed one for the uncompressed address respectively. This also confuses me immensely - why? Aren't they same the address? I guess the answer to my first question might explain also this one .

3) Can I somehow now move the amounts from both addresses (I do have the keys/control over them) at the same time for the same fee? I am trying to explore Exodus to control my keys and I can in theory move them but each transaction would cost me a separate network fee which will gut these two as they both have such little amounts in them. A follow-up on this same question - I also tested sending 3-4 small transactions to my Exodus wallet but each time I was using a separate address. Does this mean that if I ever want to get ALL of these out of there and to another wallet Exodus will treat each address separately and would the network charge me a network fee for moving the funds from each wallet or does Exodus handle this in a special way where the same (and hopefully smaller) fee is applied for moving the funds from 3-4 separate addresses to a new one?

Thanks so much for reading my questions, I hope I didn't lay it out very confusing.",1625117973,Seddyx,True,1,6,2021-07-01

Bitcoin,Why do people feel afraid of Bitcoin?,"
Someone told me not long ago: Bitcoin is a dangerous game. It is even possible for some people or groups to take over the blockchain through a majority and destroy the entire mechanism. People don't know they are playing these games.

For a long time buying Google at a high price, Amazon and Apple are both good choices for me.

Yes, there are a lot of stocks there, there are also cryptocurrencies, there are also many bonds and debt instruments.
In the US, there are obviously 9,600 mutual funds (quick Google search). The question is, which of the thousands is worth buying.

Just because some or many of the available options are not good investments, it does not mean that the entire asset class is bad.

The prosperity of encryption technology is just like the technological prosperity. They have got a lot of IPOs because of various stupid ideas. Most of these technology companies are stupid and not worth it.
Nowadays, there are many ICOs, most of them are stupid and not worth it.

However, there are still opportunities to realize value.

Also about digital assets. Digital assets have become a reality.

I emailed John McAfee for advice on this and on my lost Bitcoin.¬† The next morning he hanged himself.¬† Co-inki-dink?¬† You know what Peter Thiel says.¬† Everyone is full of shit.¬† Big or small.¬† And competition is for losers.¬† Lao Tzu the Old Master has said as much too.¬† It's like how Wall St execs used to trade based off of astrology magazines delivered to them in a brown paper bags instead of formal analysis because it tended to produce more accurate predictions.¬† Or how Putin, probably the world's biggest whale, has said he's deeply religious but doesn't like to talk about it because it's like a ""political striptease"" according to him.

All this time.¬† Still no one knows who Nakamoto is or what even Bitcoin really is beyond the white paper.¬† I think it might be a visual pun for unified field theory.¬† Waiting on NASA to get back to me (ha).",1625114312,Necessary-Swing-991,True,1,24,2021-07-01

Bitcoin,Lost over 140K CAD future trading on binance," 

wanted about 4-5k worth of crypto 4 month ago.  
quickly learn about trading and started to trade very small amount.  
I liked it

2 week fast forward I see my self losing 15k and I try to close my account on Binance.

since there's no self exclusion program it was way to easy to reopen.

4 month down the drain I now see my self lose the total amount of 140k CAD and lost my job.

I could barely sleep and shower over the last 4 month watching btc price from the moment I wake up till just before I sleep. almost dreaming about btc.

no self exclusion program, no limit deposit. I most likely ruined my self in just under 4 month.  
I don't see my V shape recovery any time soon xD.  
Future trading should could with self impose limit deposit. I never thought once in my life I had the power to drop that amount of money on a online site in a 4 month period.  
I now seek a class action or a law suit for extortion as I'm clearly suffering from mental issues.

obviously I didn't read any warning message from Binance since you can just click ok and pass them.

I came to realize that I have small chance of winning that law suit but I'm gonna give it all I can.

gambling site needs to come with regulation. and when you offer 125x and can lose life saving with 3 click of a button. I think you should clearly be regulated.

Bitcoin,Pondering on the long term viability of bitcoin,"Let me preface this by saying I'm pro-crypto in general and bitcoin specifically - be warned the rest of this is a bit of a downer.

As I see it there are two *big* issues ahead for bitcoin and one smaller one on the horizon:

0 - smaller one - with the current tendency towards lowering emissions and reducing energy consumption proof of work algorithms are looking less and less favorable. There are alternatives (proof of stake etc.) but I would guess a switch is off the cards due to the consensus vs split issues. The real humdinger with this is what happens when there is *enough* pressure on governments from climate advocates? Tax mining crypto? Crypto mining licenses with quotas? Neither seem reasonable both are well within the realms of what governments might try.

1 - big problem #1 - quantum computers will ruin the world... or so they say. The real issue here to my eye is when does bitcoin move to using something that is quantum secure and how is it agreed - I'm talking about wallets here, not mining. But to look at mining, if it can be done with a quantum computer (and I mean CPU -&gt; GPU -&gt; FPGA -&gt; ASIC... what comes next in this sequence) where does that leave us? The hash rate goes through the roof and there's no coins left to mine a week later (exaggeration but you get my point). I'm no expect but could quantum computers risk a 51%?

2 - big problem #2 - the final coin is minted. This is a ways off (about 120 years?) But as the end looms people will act. Does a limited supply mean a what we think it means. If supply doesn't go up, then price must? I'm not convinced. Once the miners are sitting only on the transaction fees there will be a lot less incentive to mine - roughly 10%? The real question becomes what it's always been with bitcoin - will it be stable? For it to get widespread enough once the mining is on the decline it will need to level off pretty hard - it doesn't really matter if its at $50k or $500k what matters is whether businesses can hold it for 24 hours without worrying about losing 5% of their value. Otherwise it just becomes a placeholder for cash - you buy with bitcoin, I instantly sell the bitcoin for the cash. Why wouldn't I just take card instead? Bitcoin is cool and loved by many - but does it make the cogs of business turn smoothly?

Bitcoin,"How Much is BTC Worth? Easy Math, Alot of Research, and Some Debate","The US has 332,475,025 citizens
(https://www.census.gov/popclock/) 

The average family size is 3.15 people
(https://www.statista.com/statistics/183657/average-size-of-a-family-in-the-us/) 

The average savings per family is $49,555.00 
(https://usdebtclock.org) 

With the #'s above, the total savings by US citizens, is $5.23T 

Now do this same analysis for all nations whose citizens have access to trading on the blockchain, and you will get the total (possible) value for BTC, assuming all other variables go unchanged. For example, it assumes people don't change the amount they invest vs spend vs save. Another assumption is that people only view it as a store of value and not an ""investment"" ( which won't be the case until after BTC's price has been fully discovered, until then it will be viewed as an investment. After price discovery then it will become a stable store of value... or savings). And I know all these variables could/will change in the future, but I'm not going to discuss the future anymore, just a snapshot of today's BTC value.

The debate is how much of people's savings would/should be allocated to BTC. I know a lot of people would argue 100%. But I think that's unrealistic, and while it would be ""statistically significant(ly)"" better than USD over the long term, I believe Hard Assets such as Farmland, Potable Water Rights/Access &amp; PM's will play a much bigger part in people's savings portfolios, especially as the younger generations continue researching, learning and challenging the Boomer way of life... I believe this portfolio balance will return, because throughout history, it's always been the case until the 1920/30's when the Great Depression hit, then the USD was removed from the gold standard and became fiat, followed soon thereafter by high risk high reward from investing the fiat in the stock market. People really began to lose sight of what's really important, and what assets you really want to have beneath you when you fall down, or better yet, when a nation or global economy starts falling down... getting back to BTC, I'd say a reasonable assumption is 10-25% of savings is in BTC, putting BTC total value at $523B-1.3T, in the US alone. 

Now I know a lot of people are going to think the best response to this post is to argue my 10-25% savings in BTC comment, but really, it's not worth debating, until someone can come up with the total amount of savings globally...",1625096434,Davie_Baby_23,True,1,15,2021-07-01

Bitcoin,"Fun free mobile game that pays you in BTC, plays similar to Pokemon Go! Only in US and Canada","There is a game that is currently in beta for residents of US/Canada named **Coin Hunt**  that is a geo-location game, like Pokemon Go, except you get paid to  hunt and you are encouraged to grow your community! The founder of this  game is the CEO of a popular cryptocurrency exchange named Bittrex. The  game also gets updates/events frequently, usually every couple weeks.  What I really like about this game is that you aren't really pushed to  leave your house everyday unless you want to overachieve on your  earnings, it is perfectly fine to stay home because there is passive  income in this game! For example, you basically earn about atleast $1 a day for just checking in to your home base in the game. Tens of  thousands of users are currently playing, and the most dedicated people  have earned maybe a thousand a month. I recommend treating it as a  marathon rather than a sprint though!

**Here is a link if you are interested in playing:** [https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Jzw4NSO6RT](https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Jzw4NSO6RT)

*Note: There is a Canada Day and July 4th event coming up with a free exclusive costume, don't miss it!*

**What do you do in the game?**  Since this is a geo-location based game, you have to go outside and  move around and the app will follow your position on the map. The two  things you'll find on your map is either a blue key or a coloured vault.  The colour of the key/vault represents its rarity, with the order of  common to most rare being blue-green-yellow-red-purple. You can use 10  blue keys to craft a green key, or 10 green keys to craft a yellow key,  so on. Depending on the vault you find out in the world, you'll need the  corresponding coloured key to open it.

Blue keys reward you with $0.10 USD equivalent in BTC  
Green keys reward  you with $1  
Yellow keys reward you with $10  
Red keys reward you with $100  (Event only)  
Purple keys reward you with $1000 (Event only)

The passive income mainly comes from checking in to the game, which as  mentioned before gives $1 a day, or from vaults that you've placed  around the world. So every user can place a total of 10 vaults anywhere,  and when any other player opens your vault you are rewarded 5% of the  resource. This means every 20 people that open your vault, would be the  same as you going out and opening someones vault (or your own). This  means if you place your vaults in spots that have a lot of user traffic,  you will be rewarded well without even having to leave your house. User  vaults can only be placed in areas where there is something  interesting, which includes stores and businesses, just anything that  isn't your house. Other people cannot place their vaults within 100 metres of your vault. This is why it's important to start playing while  the game is in beta!

**There  are also in-game costumes available in the game, with limited  quantities, which you will be able to sell in the future when the game  is out of beta.**

The game  is great, I really recommend starting as soon as you can! When you first  start the game, you start with 8 blue keys and you just need to find 2  blue keys to craft a green key and build your home base, and you will  unlock all of the essential features of the game.

**For Android:**  The game is available on the google play store, just download the game  and then use the link to open the application and complete the signup with freebies.

**For IOS:**   Apple does not approve beta applications on their store quickly, so  you must use TestFlight to download the application instead.

Bitcoin,1% a day strategy | Does it really work?,"Hello people of reddit! So I recently watched this video where this dude spoke of a 1% profit per day strategy using day trades where he had initially invested $20,000 and kept on making 1% each day and kept reinvesting the profits into the principle and repeated it till he made over $600,000 in the span of like 12-14 months. So once I made the math, if he had continued for over 2 years, he would've made $4+ Million which would've been insane. So, the question is, is this actually doable? If it is, would trades of such high volume be executed in one go? I'm relatively new to the crypto space so if this all sounds dumb, just don't mind lol

Bitcoin,Questions about the Flippening and BTC Maximalists.,"I'm a genuinely curious person getting into and enjoying crypto a ton. I was talking to someone on Telegram and he couldn't answer all my questions, so he referred me here and said the community is very open and willing to help and answer questions, so here I go!

I'd like for someone to change my mind and provide me with information other than ""BTC is the original coin with the best reputation.""

I don't understand the BTC maximalist philosophy, given ETH exists. ETH has been making incredible headway with Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and similar L2 solutions, as well as the prevalence of DAOs, not to mention DeFi and the possible revolution of the financial industry, and LINK/oracle solutions, as well as The Graph as the central nervous system of the project.

BTC has BCH and BSV, both scams with zero use-case, which has come out of the project. I can't help but to see BTC as MySpace, and ETH as Facebook, which constantly develops and adapts.

I'm aware of BTC's lightning network, but hasn't that become a meme at this point? I own BTC, I want to see it succeed, I just don't understand BTC maximalism and why anyone would say it has more potential than ETH. Thank you.",1625086811,ProTutorMathz,True,1,11,2021-07-01

Bitcoin,Do you pay with Bitcoin whenever you're able to?,"
 
I believe that the majority wants to see Bitcoin being globally adopted, including myself; I imagine people using it in their daily transactions for food, coffee etc. Lightning payments can tackle the scaling issue and the only thing left for Bitcoin to be used as a currency from the whole world is its mass usage. If the adoption rate increased so would the price's standability. 
 
So, do you set a good example and pay with Bitcoin whenever you're able to or do you prefer not to spend your coins? I'll speak my personal view about this, in my country none of the merchants accept it and I rarely buy some hosting services from the internet. If they do accept it, I'll pay for it, but not because it satisfies me; it's just that I can't with PayPal. I'd prefer paying with PayPal for online services, because I may be scammed if they aren't popular.

Bitcoin,Deflation: the real reason it's good for you,"tl;dr: No matter who you are, deflation can be good for you. But there are some misleading misconceptions.

When most people talk about deflationary vs inflationary financial instruments, they assume that deflation is good because ""savings are the difference between production and consumption."" Which is true for most people, but NOT MOST WEALTH.

This is because most wealth is held by entities that produce nothing, whether we're talking about ultra wealthy individuals or the state.

This entire logic train that ""savings = production -consumption"" is based on the assumption that the people reaping the profits from production are the people doing the producing, which is seldom the case.

I have run several businesses in my life, large and small, and I've consistently made the most money by paying a small amount of money to other people to produce things, which I then charge other people a large amount of money to buy, then pocketing the difference. Any business owner who has done well will tell you that human capital - the balancing act of hiring the best possible people for the least possible pay - is key to long term success.

And, this is the real hangup. Anyone who has run a business will tell you, you wanna maximize the amount of money you can charge people for the crap you sell. Which means you want wages to be high in general. Which means you want all other businesses to be as generous as possible (thus trapping less wealth).

But pretty much every business I've ever run, the biggest expense is... payroll. So to maximize my own profits, I want to pay my employees as little as I can without sacrificing quality.

This is why we have boom and bust cycles, because it's in my business as a capitalist to horde my wealth and drive down wages at my companies, but it's against my interest for everyone else to do that. And if every single business owner AND employee horded twice as much money as they do now and didn't spend it out into the economy... that's what we call a depression.

This doesn't mean inflationary money is good. Inflation doesn't really affect hording or expending of wealth from the TRULY wealthy all that much BECAUSE WEALTHY PEOPLE NEVER HOLD THEIR WEALTH IN INFLATIONARY FIAT.

Only poor working people keep their money in fiat because they typically work paycheck to paycheck and need immediate access to their money, and they literally can't afford the risk exposure of investment. So deflationary currency will benefit working people a lot, assuming it succeeds, by giving working people a foothold for retirement and other long term building.

Sorry, I know this was a long rant, but the idea that everyone just holding onto all their wealth and stockpiling all their ""profits"" is good for the economy is so backwards. A healthy economy is one where things are moving all the time, a market which is efficiently transferring commodities to people who need them the most. Unfortunately that's pretty much not how things work in our economy, as I explain here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/nnxssa/we_do_the_work_they_take_the_profits_some/

The best most of us can do is try to defend ourselves against these monumental tidal forces of the ultra wealthy accumulating and trapping wealth. Pretending those forces are good for everyone (which they spend a lot of money trying to convince us all is true in their media) is a fast way to financial ruin, which is why we need to be realists and study how things REALLY function so we don't get stomped like most poors (which = most people).

Inflation is REALLY harmful to the majority of working people precisely because most people have great difficulty building savings or buying better assets (most folks in the USA, the richest country on earth, live paycheck to paycheck) and 2-3% inflation is brutal for those folks.

For wealthy people, inflation can be completely avoided. For them, BTC's chief value isn't ever going to be deflation, but PROFITS they can reap through the platform. Totally different game they're playing than most working stiffs, you see. (Again, see my post link above)

So, if you're wealthy... hopefully you already know what you're doing, and it should be easy to hold onto your wealth (by siphoning it up from people who are doing the actual producing - which is literally what we call ""investing"" in the vast majority of cases)

But if you're NOT wealthy, don't try to pretend you are UNTIL you are and you have enough money stockpiled up to make your money do all the work so you don't have to.

I'm expecting a lot of folks to downvote this because it challenges the prominent narrative. I don't care, because the prominent narrative is deliberate disinformation that can lead to bad decisions. Keep stacking sats and best of luck!",1625077332,AwfulWaffler,True,1,1,2021-07-01

Bitcoin,Is Bitcoin better than Fiat?,"
For the first time in history, money is separated from the state. Bitcoin aims to be an alternative to Fiat currencies by providing financial inclusion to anyone, anywhere in the world. A system governed by mathematics and cryptography will put an end to corruption once and for all. The pioneer cryptocurrency can be used globally without limitations thanks to its decentralized model. People can send cross-border payments in minutes without the need for ID verification, background checks, or credit checks of any kind. This brings a whole new era of financial sovereignty as we know it.

Bitcoin,Just tried the lightning network for the first time and my eyes are OPENED,"Funded my lightning wallet with $10 and sent 1000 satoshis to a friend for the cost of 1 satoshi using Breez. Wallet setup was all automatic and so easy to use.

I recall seeing a top voted comment critisizing LN over a year ago which I now see was complete BS. The comment I read was saying that LN can never catch on because in order to onboard you must perform an on-chain transaction and since bitcoin can only support around 7 transactions per second it would thus take decades to on-board the world population.

Now that I've used LN I see that comment is full of shit. Yes, I myself had to perform an on-chain transaction, but my friend that I sent sats to never had to do such a thing. This means that one entity can potentially onboard MILLIONS of users with a SINGLE on-chain transaction.

I think of the el salvador government and I assume they are doing exactly this. They will be sending every adult $30 worth of bitcoin. That's over 130 million dollars worth of bitcoin. They can send that entire amount of bitcoin to their personal government lightning network address. This will be one on-chain transaction. From this point on they can send $30 of bitcoin to over 4 million adults individually to their corresponding lightning network addresses for a total transaction fee cost of 0.1% which is actually pretty amazing if you compare that to the traditional banking system.

I encourage everyone here to play around with the lightning network. Maybe next time you have poker night with the boys get them all to install a lightning wallet and gamble away using sats. I can only see the lightning network getting better from here. Right now you have to scan a qr code but I'm sure in the near future we can use NFC and simply tap to pay with LN.",1625076778,Expired_Lizard_Milk,True,1,83,2021-07-01

Bitcoin,Randomized mining as a method for reducing power usage?,"I've been reading recently about the insane amount of energy that goes into mining bitcoins. I'm not generally and environmentalist alarmist, but 5% of world electricity does seem a little insane, right?

What I realized though... it it doesn't have to be this way. If less people were mining a bitcoin, then the difficulty would just go down, and the power usage would go down as well. I was trying to thinking if there was a simple solution to this. I've heard of ""proof-of-stake"" which sounds interesting, but is also a pretty big departure from the current system.

What if, instead, we used a randomized selection for each block of, say, 10,000 TB of available mining RAM/GPU (or some other suitable number). So if you make your machine available for mining, it has a probability of being chosen proportional to it's computing power. This not only could significantly reduce power output, but it *doesn't change miners incentive, and actually increases profit.* If the probability of being chosen is proportional to mining capacity, then your probability of being the one to mine the current coin should be relatively unchanged, and your electricity output would be significantly reduced.

Thoughts? And, would their actually be any way to implement this in bitcoin if the political will existed, or would a totally new currency be needed?",1625067511,Any-Fig-921,True,1,24,2021-06-30

Bitcoin,Intrinsic value is exactly what Bitcoin has.,"Intrinsic : **Belonging to the real nature of a thing; not dependent on external circumstances.**

**: Of or relating to the essential nature of a thing; inherent.**

&amp;#x200B;

Value  :  **Worth in usefulness or importance to the possessor.**

&amp;#x200B;

There are of course a number of definitions for 'value' but I think we generally understand the meaning of it to be along the lines of 'worth' or 'importance'.

So intrinsic value would imply something along the lines of : 'inherent importance'. A worthiness based upon what it is itself and not dependent upon external circumstances.

And in a sense, everything has a certain intrinsic value. For eg. Portland cement is inherently worthy because it is good at setting when combined with water. That is its 'valuable inherent nature'.  

Water keeps us and all life alive, it hydrates everything that needs hydrating, so that is arguably waters inherent value.

Golds inherent value is probably its malleable workable texture as a soft yellow metal which means it can be used for jewelry and industry.

Golds 'monetary' worth is dependent upon it having been allocated a monetary worth based upon these external circumstances along with its prettiness in jewelry or its difficulty of mining and relative scarcity. Its monetary value has been allocated and can be un-allocated by the centralized legacy financial controllers.

What is Bitcoins 'valuable inherent nature'? 

Well, in essence it was created to *be* new money. That is the designed nature of it and the system which supports it, that is the starting point of why it is considered worthy and why people swap their old money for it. 

The network effect that has followed and all its other brilliant characteristics increase its value because they make it better and better at being money. 

But its 'valuable inherent nature' or 'intrinsic value' is that it was created for the sole purpose of being money.

It has always made more sense to me that it is better to have something solely dedicated to being money than something which can be temporary allocated. 

One could say Fiat money is dedicated to that purpose and so it is, but its downfall is that it is owned and controlled by a small amount of people and manipulable to such a degree as to make it unacceptable to those who prefer to *own* their own money. 

Bitcoin is better, freer, fairer money. 

That *is* its 'intrinsic value.'",1625066966,ravenhands,True,1,5,2021-06-30

Bitcoin,I'm seriously pondering making a move abroad to a btc legal tender nation. Who has has this on the cards?,"Ok, I've spent alot of time recently delving into what it would take to get to South America. 3 btc for permininent residency in El Salvador. Paraguay apparently with .2 btc and you can get permininent residency. Or be a Bitcoin entrepreneur in Salvador and get perm residency. Plus the costs of travel and hotels etc untill I'm settled

It dosnt come without the risk like been a gringo etc and potential crime against yourself however the positives are remarkably impressive.

I've been seeking work in crypto for a month now. Applied for a few jobs at NFT marketplaces for a verification and support role as I'm good with computers understand the space well. I can code html, CSS and some PHP but to really embrace Bitcoin/crypto I need that more extensive experience in coding. Solidity, python, JavaScript etc.  I've set a horizon of 2 to 5 years to make the move, till then, hodl, work my ass off whilst staking sats and make connections with others who are deadset interested. 

I would far prefer Paraguay over el Salvador,  chilli is the safest by far and uraguay has Europe vibes but alot more expensive to live. 

I honestly see the future is bright in this region as Bitcoin becomes more and more adopted by the continent which we are slowly seeing happen. 

It's like been a missionary I guess. I honestly love and believe in what the tech can do. I believe this aligns alot with my values and to help others if I can in these countries.

Bitcoin,Will other countries adopt Bitcoin as legal tender after El Salvador‚Äôs move?,"
El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. In a time where Fiat currencies are devaluing because of inflation, this is a pretty smart move. It's no secret that cryptocurrencies are becoming extremely popular in third-world countries. If this keeps up, Bitcoin may be able to destroy Fiat in its entirety. 
 
Now, it's only a matter of time before other countries follow suit in adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. It's yet the time where a developed country hasn't adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. The United States, The United Kingdom, and other powerful countries still rely on Fiat. Imagine what will happen if they decide to abandon Fiat in favor of Bitcoin. It would decentralize the global economy. 
 
Do you think other countries will follow El Salvador's decision of adopting Bitcoin as legal tender? If not, why? Your input will be greatly appreciated.",1625060636,VeronZ76,True,1,3,2021-06-30

Bitcoin,Thinking about going all in on $MSTR as a pseudo-Bitcoin ETF. Disprove my logic.,"Hi Everyone,

First of all, I am a crypto holder (just BTC &amp; ETH), and I don't have any more cash to buy the dip.

However, as an investor I have money in stocks as well obviously.  My investments in stocks are all in low cost, total market index funds (Boglehead strategy).  They're doing fine (\~15% return this year or something, idk), but fuck it.  I'm a young single dude, so I can afford to take some risks right now.  I want to YOLO it all on a high risk high, reward bet.  That said, I'm considering selling all of my stock investments, and putting it all on $MSTR for the second half of the year to ride the bull run back up past the $100K mark we think BTC will hit.  

The charts for $MSTR seem to track BTC very well, so I feel as though if BTC crushes like we think it will, then so will $MSTR and the other pseudo-Bitcoin ETF stocks like $MARA and $RIOT.

$MSTR opened at \~$650, so a ride to ATH's at $1,315 would be a 100% gain.  Can probably get it in the $500's or maybe even $400's if we dip again, which would be a 120%+ gain if it matched ATH's.  If we believe (which I strongly do) that BTC will crack $100K, $MSTR could crush to $2,000+.

Also considering $MARA, and $RIOT as other ""Bitcoin ETF's"", but I like $MSTR cause of Saylor.

Call me crazy.  Disprove my logic.  I want to hear the arguments against this.  Mods, sorry if this isn't the right sub for this.

I replied ""of course I did."", knowing that he (as an old fashioned-, retired-, stock guy who likes to argue) was starting an argument about it. He started ranting on how it is just one big scam and ""all those other bitcoins"" (meaning altcoins red.) are even more so. And they have no real value or use, now or in the future. So I asked why he was thinking that, giving the fact that his statement was so absolute. The poor man based his assumption on just one (!) article in the financial times, ""and other articles"" but he couldn't clarify which ones. He also stated that he never seen any blockchain is use in practice. So I started to explain what blockchain does and what the difference is between different coins or tokens. He simply replied: ""if you believe that, than you are a believer and just as well join a church"". With those kind of arguments, you can basically never lose one..

Bitcoin,"Fools! Bitcoin is going to fail, you've been warned!","Don't be angry at me. I'm here to help you understand because most of you are stupid enough to fall for this scam. 

First of all, Bitcoin is not a store of value! A store of value has to.. surprise! actually, store value over the long term. Bitcoin's value fell by 50% between April 14 and June 22! Is that what you call a store of value? Wow! What a great new form of money! Imagine getting paid your salary and watching it lose 50% of its value over two months. What type of idiot is going to use this as money?  

It's really not that hard to understand, Just type ""store of value"" into Wikipedia if that helps. The first sentence reads: 

""A **store of value** is any commodity or asset that would normally retain purchasing power into the future and is the function of the asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be *predictably* useful when retrieved.""

Is there anything ***predictable*** about Bitcoin? *Fools!*

In order for something to function as money, it has to gain a large network effect of people willing to exchange their labor and time for it. This is never going to happen with Bitcoin because it SUCKS! it's unstable!

What's more, Bitcoin doesn't scale! it's like 6 tx per second max. World currency my ASS! It's like saying let's fit a million people on a tiny wooden boat, this boat is the future! How stupid can people be? Why would anyone want to pay 60$ in fees just to buy something? The fees only get worse as more people use the coin at which point it becomes a useless expensive piece of crap.

What's this I'm hearing? You, think Lightning is going to save Bitcoin? ok, let's do some monkey math. The population in the US alone is 328.2M. A Bitcoin block can contain a maximum of about 3,500 tx per block. So if we wanted to open a single channel for every person in the US it will take around:

***328,200,000 / 3,500 = 93,771.4285714 blocks.*** 

***Let's divide this by the number of blocks in a day (6\*24 = 144), so:*** 

***93,771.4285714 / 144 = 651.19047619 days = 1.784 years!!***

Yes, in order for everyone in the US alone to open a Lightning channel for themselves it would take 1.78 years! And that's only a single channel for every person. For Lightning, you also need to close and rebalance channels all the time. Basically, this is not even close to being realistic. 

Lightning also comes with so many complications and vulnerabilities (routing issues, channel management, liquidity, flood &amp; loot attack, etc.) that the only way it can work is if it becomes a mostly custodial system with a few big players who route and manage all the payments on everyone's behalf. What a stupid solution! This is not even Bitcoin anymore it's the *F\*\*\*ing banking system!* except it's worse because you need to quickly convert the volatile crap back into stable dollars to buy anything. What a load of BS!

I also hear a lot about Bitcoin being ""decentralized"" and outside ""government control"". What the heck are people smoking? You do understand governments can easily shutdown exchanges, shutdown big miners, make accepting Bitcoins in shops illegal. All of which could potentially wipe out the ""Bitcoin economy"" if you can even call it that. Sure, people can continue running some version of Bitcoin on their stupid home PC's but then it's just passing useless tokens around and pretending it's money like little kids who play with their power ranger toys.

Some people claim that Bitcoin is a store of value simply because it's scarce, like Gold! and would therefore appreciate in value over the long term.

So let's think about that... Bitcoin is valuable *because* it's a store of value and it's a store of value *because* it's going to be more valuable in the future as people realize it's a store of value *because* they can sell it to new people who understand that it's valuable *because* it increases in value *because* it goes up forever... WOW, that's some circular monkey logic indeed!!

Do you know what else is monkey logic? PONZI schemes! Yes, Bitcoin is a giant decentralized Ponzi where all the old investors are shilling and lying to newbies so they can dump on them and make easy m$$$y! 

Just like any good-old Ponzi, it all comes crashing down in the end. You have been warned!

Also, saying Bitcoin is anything like GOLD is just dumb wrong. Gold is a real physical element on the periodic table and has real uses in the economy including jewelry, electronics, and medicine. Bitcoin is just a computer game for passing tokens that wastes a lot of energy. Fools!!  

Now that I think about it, this is probably the worst scammy part about Bitcoin. Not only is it a cheap pump &amp; dump, but it also wastes massive amounts of energy and electronic hardware to run itself. If Bitcoin had any real-world utility maybe the energy use would be justified. But the reality is it's far from being the definition of money and is really just a system for transferring gambling tokens around. 

Bitcoin will eventually die (yay) as a result of all this wastefulness. The high energy usage is something that gets noticed outside of Bitcoin delusion land. Smart people in society are not going to tolerate a giant Ponzi that consumes the energy of an entire country. Regulations and heavy taxation of miners will start being introduced. China has already started banning miners. The public with the help from the media and Elon will become more aware of this energy-wasting scam which will drive more social pressure to not use Bitcoin so the environment can be saved. 

This is the beginning of the end for Bitcoin. As your financial adviser, I recommend you sell all of it now!

IMO that is no longer the case. I remember when Bitcoin had a changetip bot and it was possible to send micro payments.

Is this even possible anymore or are we just accepting that Bitcoin is now only a store of value and no longer digital cash?

I hear everyone talking about HODLing and never spending. Why?

Bitcoin,First decentralized blacklist. Are you tired of bots and scams?,"# Problem

## Front running bot

Bot and front-running bot is becoming an obsession of market participants crypto DEX. 

Especially for new tokens, every transaction that has the potential to increase the token price is caught by front running bots. Make investors lose money right after the trade. 

This makes investors afraid to participate in the DEX market, and it has hindered the development of the DEX market in particular and the crypto market in general.

## Hacking in DEFI

From 2018 to now, every year dozens of hacks occur with billions of dollars in damage to the community.

Since it is a decentralized application, these wallet addresses are all without anything to stop it. Current hacks are still happening daily, crashing projects and investors have lost a lot of money.

## Phishing projects

Phishing projects are also becoming increasingly popular. That also hinders the development of the whole market. Scam projects should not have appeared. Owners of scam projects after withdrawing money are still cavalier without anyone being able to do anything.

Blockchain is transparency, anonymity, but by no means fraud, hacking, and illegal profiteering. We need solutions to stop these things.

# Solution

We have implemented a solution and proposed to make it a new standard for ERC20, BEP20, ERC721 tokens, and exchanges, farming, games, dapps **Decentralized blacklist**.   Constantly updating and adding ""black"" addresses to the list is very expensive (needs a lot of transaction gas fees). And each project also needs to keep a close eye on the market developments of the hacks to be able to update in time, which is also a very difficult thing. Front running bots also need an automatic scanning and updating system to be able to stop them in time.

Unity is a strength, if a blacklist of addresses is centrally managed in a smart contract and other projects use them together, it will save a lot of costs, manpower, and data is also updated, continuously updated.

### üî• Bot hunter

Bothunter is our blockchain data collection and scanning system. We collect and analyze all transactions on famous exchanges like uniswap, pancake swap, ... and automatically detect the front-running transactions bot. (the list is updated here (link). this list will be automatically added to the blacklist in smart contract.

### üî• Report

Our website has a function to report phishing addresses, hacker addresses. People can visit here (link) and report those addresses. To be accepted, you need to provide enough evidence of the attack or Scams  

### üî• Manual

Our team always closely monitors developments of the market, press, news channels. As soon as a hack or scam occurs, the relevant addresses of the hacker, scammer will be put on the blacklist.

Bitcoin,All Money is an illusion.,"Money, Currency, Assets, physical gold or digital coins! 

Money in any form is never real, and never has been or will be.

Labour in kind for goods is civilisation! 

Overpopulation and globalisation of commerce has made people labour for a type of money! More people, more jobs, more jobs more specified areas of jobs. More specified areas of jobs means more jobs to manage those.

The only reason over-popularisation has a footing is because we allow it being forced on us. 
We have the land globally to produce endless amounts of food, we have the tech and transport to configure and easily work a global system of essential goods.

We have science that is so advanced we can produce lab grown meat. 

Politics and corruption have made it as hard as they can push to see how easy life could be and replace it with money.


Im no socialist or anything else. I enjoy logic, we need a globally agreed value of something to travel and trade, but it doesn‚Äôt have to have control by a few, or be classed as money of wealth. There really is a less than 1% of population globally who own over 99% of everything.

There is no poor nations, only nations that have been exploited by wealthier ones for their metals, minerals, or worse forced labour.

The world needs to change, and carbon neutral companies parading like bohemian gods won‚Äôt get the job done.

Nationalism is fine, pride is fine, anger is fine, in fact anything you have learnt beside self-preservation and the instinctual fear of imbalance, often a falling sensation, IS LEARNT!

Bitcoin couLd be the closest thing we have seen as yet to become anything close to a globally recognised, globally transferable at speeds unthinkable of wealth before ( aka gold being shipped across an ocean) 

The entire world has untold amounts of beliefs and traditional values. 

No one entity will ever control the globe. 
It has been proven throughout our history, time and time again. 

Fundamental shifts in humanity have happened almost regularly for the past 2000 years.
0bc/ad roman empire
500ad dark ages and confusion establishment of power from the lack kf roman control.
1000ad fuedalism
1500ad church control
2000ad - shit so far. Fear and self importance has got use fucked up.

This is a civilisation shift to a digital world. Do some looking. What was thought to be sci-fi star trek shit is becoming a reality for us at exponential rates.

In short, 
Bitcoin isn‚Äôt perfect, but what is?
It works and can be used without corruption by the 99% if the 99% of people wanted it to. Belief in anything is everything.

If you never see with your own eyes something you think is true, you are in belief of what has been told.

I believe that in order for Bitcoin to be more valuable, you should be able to get more Bitcoin by investing in Bitcoin without relying on dollars.

Because I want to use bitcoins in the real economy, but when bitcoins decrease, I have to buy them again in dollars, so I don't use bitcoins.

Here's an example in dollars:

\- When you deposit money in a bank, you get 2% interest per year

\- When a stock rises by 50%, from $1,000 to $1,500

Of course, it is best to receive salary income in Bitcoin, but we will exclude it because it is difficult to realize in a short period of time.

Bitcoin,help : how to recover funds from old multibit wallet .key file,"Quite a few years back I had a few BTC pennies in an old multibit wallet on a desktop which had died of old age. since at the time a few BTC pennies wasn't worth the trouble I let it die in peace but kept the carcass thinking that if one day it will be worth it I'll have the option of trying to recover them (and prove that keeping all kinds of junk around the house isn't always such a bad thing). anyway a few days back I took advantage of the fact a computer repair guy was at my place for some unrelated issues to ask him to see if maybe he could revive it and after some tinkering I got a few minutes of access to my old desktop (although without internet because it would crash whenever we tried to connect it) and access to my multibit wallet. now since without internet sending the funds to a different address was not an option I did what I thought was the next best thing which was to export the private keys which gave me a .key file which I naively thought would contain a single address and a single private key with which I could access the funds but it turns out it contains quite a lot of addresses (and keys, I presume). my question is: what now? should I simply try each of the addresses on the file to see which contains funds in the correct amount and then try different keys from the file to try and unlock it or is there some logic to this file and there is a faster and easier way?  (mind you it's a really old multibit wallet, probably before seed words were even introduced)..",1625033927,Emergency_Gene_2091,True,1,7,2021-06-30

Bitcoin,Taxable events.,"Is it just me, or is it outside of the realm of reason to expect us to actually track every taxable event we incur in our crypto dealings.  I mean, I have incurred tons of taxable events before I even knew that I should be tracking them, and it all seemed too tedious for the amount of money I was investing, so I have never once payed attention to these taxable events, nor do I ever really plan to pay the taxes for them.  Realistically, for someone with less than 10k in crypto, will this become a big problem for me.  Obviously the advice you want to give me is ""pay your taxes,"" but I'm not looking for that - I already know that.  I just choose not to.

Bitcoin,We need a Decentralized On-Chain Bitcoin Lobby.,"Serious proposal here...

Political and regulatory concerns are currently the biggest impediments to wider Bitcoin adoption. The problem is there are a bunch of geriatric gate-keepers that seem incapable of understanding Bitcoin, and they are standing in it's way. Typically an ""industry group"" will form lobby to address key issues, grease the right palms &amp; schmooze the right politicians and their ilk. Two examples immediately come to mind (if there's more please share).  The problem is that both of these groups represent ***Big-Crypto******^(TM)***  and not the average ***Bitcoin User******^(PLEB)******,*** ***and neither*** is focused on Bitcoin exclusively.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Crypto Council for Innovation**](https://cryptoforinnovation.org/) \- The Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) is a global alliance of crypto industry leaders with a mission to demonstrate the transformational promise of crypto and communicate its benefits to policymakers, regulators, and people around the globe.

   **SUPPORTERS** \- [Coinbase, Paradigm, Fidelity &amp; Square](https://cryptoforinnovation.org/#supporters)

&amp;#x200B;

[**Blockchain Association**](https://theblockchainassociation.org/) \- We are the Blockchain Association, a member led, member driven organization dedicated to improving the public policy environment for crypto networks.

   **MEMBERS -** [Exchanges, networks, software &amp; hardware manufactures](https://theblockchainassociation.org/members/) (basically everyone except Coinbase, Paradigm, Fidelity &amp; Square)

&amp;#x200B;

Since both of these lobbying groups represent ***Big-Crypto******^(TM)*** and not the average **Bitcoin User****^(PLEB)** ,  I seriously doubt they have your best interest in mind. I know everyone has some affinity with at least SOME of these companies, but they are still **for-profit** operations and they will lobby toward their own interests and goals, not Bitcoin's, and certainly not *yours.*

# How about creating a Decentralized Bitcoin Lobby that is:

**1.** **Funded by Bitcoin Users****^(PLEB)** 

\- Operations will be sustained via BTC donations from anyone 

\- Larger donations do not buy a louder voice or more control over operations

&amp;#x200B;

2. **Directed by Bitcoin Users****^(PLEB)**  

\- Only addresses donating more than *(x)* BTC can vote by sending 2 Sats for YES or 1 Sat for NO for any given proposal (we can argue about that threshold in just a bit) 

\- Only one vote per donor address (consensus reqs TBD by community)

&amp;#x200B;

3. **Completely Decentralized &amp; On-Chain**

\- It' is effectively a non-profit LLC run off cascading multi-sig smart-contracts

\- Hyper-minimal overhead (staff &amp; OPS budgets) needed, but basically only for paperwork  

\- Donor-votes determine the lobbying issue/agenda, and lobbyists (*whoever*) can apply to *champion* the approved issue/agenda for a given BTC reward. Donors must reach a consensus on awarding the job to the most qualified candidate per issue/agenda. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know there are a lot of holes, but there are smarter people that I here that could help fill in the gaps. 

Some unanswered question I already see are...

1. How do we limit voting to a unique donating-individual without needing KYC or some other de-anonymizing process?  How do we prevent someone from creating 1000 wallets and sending the minimum donation threshold from each to buy 999 more votes? 
2. How do we build consensus mechanisms to dictate the proposal of new issues/agendas to lobby  for that best represent the average *Bitcoin User**^(PLEB)* or Bitcoin's ethos at large?
3. How do we manage scoping, approval &amp; awarding of contracts to the best qualified candidates (lobbyists), and not to the lowest bidders, or an unfaithful actor? 
4. How do we create an LLC entirely run off Bitcoin smart-contracts (or another purpose-built block-chain) to manage a hyper-minimal full-time staff that relies on the donor-voting consensus to implement their job duties? 
5. How do we ensure decentralization, anonymity &amp; dedication to the plight of the average *Bitcoin User**^(PLEB)* *?*

I am but a lowly pleb, but I'm begging those smarter than I to make this happen. 

Call it the ‚Çøecentralobby...IDK.

Bitcoin,Is there a point of functional impossibility?,So to premise this post. I am a firm believer in Bitcoin and in the disruption or rather the ascension it has in the financial world. So my question is this and this is something I've been pondering about. As you all are very aware of; many Bitcoins have been locked in unreachable wallets or lost in destroyed laptops etc. With the rescent news of the passing of a Bitcoin billionaire one can imagine that now those Bitcoins are lost forever as well. So is there a point when there are too few Bitcoin that the population wouldn't find a functional use for the token? I am aware that Bitcoin practically can be divided into infinite amounts in Satoshis but then where does that leave any remaining Bitcoin and it's purpose on the planet. I've researched that atleast 25% of Bitcoin are lost so what happens if that number becomes 75% or such? In the future will the population just not find a use case for Bitcoin due to the low availability or will the holders of Bitcoin practically be in the Elysium space station above Earth and the non holders in the wasteland below?,1625022320,Eco-Chamber,True,1,7,2021-06-30

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is freedom whereas CBDC's are government scams.. 80% of money we use is already digital currency issued by central banks! They just want a better way to track, trace and tax citizens/ corporations.. otherwise what's really their point?","Governments are racing to create their own ""CBDC""s.. Central Bank Digital Currencies.

However.. a quick look at your bank balance will tell you we're clearly already using central bank digital currency and have been doing so for many many years....

Take the Bank Of England for example... their website couldn't be clearer....

*""Banks create around 80% of money in the economy as electronic deposits in this way. In comparison, banknotes and coins only make up 3%. Finally, most banks have accounts with us at the Bank of England, allowing them to transfer money back and forth. This is called electronic central bank money, or reserves.""*

https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/knowledgebank/how-is-money-created

Many think that CBDC'S won't even use blockchain so surely we're already using near enough what we would have... unless governments want to build in some extra special features......

Even if people want a CBDC... surely we'd want a global currency backes by gold like money used to be...

We have global organisations such as NATO, WHO etc why are Governments racing to build their own CBDC""s and not working on a collaborative global currency?

Bitcoin,Never sell your Bitcoin?,"Hello everyone, 

I just wanted to see what the overall consensus was on selling Bitcoin. The well-known Bitcoin advocate Mr. Michael Saylor has already stated that you should never sell your Bitcoin and that you should hold onto it for life. He argues that when you sell you're Bitcoin you're taxed, but if you hold onto it you can borrow against the Bitcoin (tax-free) at a decent interest rate. Platforms such as Block Fi offer this type of service. 

What do you guys think about this? If I double my investment during this next bull run it would be tempting not to sell a little bit for liquidity purposes. I do love Bitcoin and the direction it's going so I plan on investing in this for the long term regardless of short-term price fluctuations.

Bitcoin,I am pissed.,"I am pissed.   
I am pissed because I have a strong opinion on favour of Bitcoin. And... I'm really not a person of strong opinions. I dislike having strong opinions. I had learned earlier in life that if you have a strong opinion on something, you are already losing. There must be something you did not understand yet.

Yet, I am pissed, because I want to find good and convincing contrarian views on Bitcoin. I have the feeling that all of the economists writing against Bitcoin are weak and mostly doing it just out of the blue: none really give signs of understanding the protocol. Arguments such ""naturally formed ponzi"", ""tulip mania v2.0"", ""deflationary=bad"", ""infinte value? = scam"" and other analogies tend to be incomplete and always lack data or evidence. It just does not make the cut for me that you are a Nobel prize if your text does not show you to have invested the minimum time to understand the protocol.  


Krugman, Roubini, the crazy dude on r/CryptoReality, they only have partially sensible arguments. And I am really pissed, I need to be convinced it is better to be in the middle ground, I want go to the next page in my life. Aren't there better thinkers? C'mon there must be provable facts against Bitcoin's monetization, right? Does anyone has really excellent contrarian texts?

Bitcoin,Teach a man to fish... Educating the less fortunate.,"Hello fellow bitcoin holders. As many of you know El Salvador will, as of September 7th, provide an app that will allow its citizens to use bitcoin as legal tender. Having lived there until I was 10 and I've kept up to date on the general situation in the country (I would love to retire there) The news was a positive and welcoming message, if nothing comes from this at least it was a nice PR and a lot of people heard something, for once, not related to violence in El Salvador. Back in 2001 when El Salvador made the US dollar it's main currency many people lost money due to people taking advantage of the situation and lack of education. Many people traded their hard earned money for fake money, since some of them didn't know what the US dollar looked like. Fast forward to today and my only fear about making bitcoin legal tender is a repeat of what happened in 2001. My idea: create a small blog/website with information on what it is, and how it works. People are afraid of what they don't know. This would be free there would be no fees or information taken from anyone it would be strictly to educate. Focus on the types of scams out there and how to keep your digital wallet safe. I'm here asking for your opinion, resources of information, help if you wish. I want people to embrace it and maybe feel safer knowing what it is they are getting. Any feedback would be appreciated.",1624991234,somewheres,True,1,3,2021-06-30

Bitcoin,Mysterious Bitcoin Maximalist Mircea Popescu Allegedly Found Dead," 

**Mpex founder and Bitcoin evangelist Mircea Popescu reportedly submerged off the coast of Central American country, adding to the mystery encompassing the person, his reputed bitcoin fortune, and what it'd mean for the longer term of the network.**

**Father of ‚ÄúBitcoin Toxicity‚Äù round-faced No Shortage of difference**

**Just like the onymous Satoshi Nakamoto sparked an exciting search for the verity identity of the person or persons behind Bitcoin, the network has reportedly lost one among its most enigmatic and polarizing figures of the last decade.**

**Mircea Popescu, a Romanian national and noted Bitcoin maximalist WHO secure to dump over a million bitcoins if block sizes were adjusted, purportedly submerged off the coast of Central American country on Gregorian calendar month twenty third. Confirmation of his passing has been scant, with retailers originally coverage that a Polish national had submerged.**

**A relatively mysterious figure at intervals in the community, very little is thought regarding Popescu except for his blogging on Trilema, support for security-focused ASCII text file comes, and dedication to keeping the Bitcoin network unchanged despite imply larger block sizes.**

**After blogging on cryptocurrency in its early years, he supported bitcoin exchange Mpex in 2012, which later became the target of a United States of America Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation. Satoshi DICE, a preferred gambling website that solely accepted bitcoin, was listed on Romanian-based Mpex by Eric Voorhees.**

**Eventually, the listing became an area of the SEC investigation when the regulator approved the giving. Voorhees was later punished and made to shop for back the shares that were listed. Popescu was far-famed for angling the SEC throughout the case, going to date on post his correspondence with the social control team in his Trilema journal. His eccentricity was on full show as he was taken off to dismantle the SEC‚Äôs requests and lay vacant the holes in their arguments for data regarding Mpex and consumer activities.**

**Despite the limited illustrious regarding his personal and skilled endeavours, Popescu‚Äôs commitment to ASCII text file systems is acknowledged. when the ASCII text file package Open BSD, which has been around since the Nineties, saw funding problems, Popescu gave $20,000 in 2014 to stay the non-profit foundation behind the code running. Given the security-centric approach of the OS and Popescu‚Äôs leanings, Mpex extensively utilized the technology in its platform.**

**Mired indifference for years, Popescu left behind several quotes and sayings, a number of that painted a reasonably negative image of the person himself. Yet, none of his antics was taken thus seriously as his promise to dump 1,000,000 bitcoins within the market if changes were created to Bitcoin block sizes (this reportedly occurred in 2016), earning him the appellation ‚ÄúFather of Bitcoin Toxicity.‚Äù Eventually, Segwit2x, Associate in a Nursing initiative designed to double the block size to 2MB, was abandoned and cemented the network‚Äôs use of the 1MB block size.**

**Despite ne'er being confirmed, it had been inferred that Popescu did command management over that immense swathe of 1,000,000 bitcoin, which, if true, created him doubtless the sole bitcoin wealthy person (owner of over a million coins). However, this figure was ne'er confirmed. It did produce issues in lightweight of his alleged death, though, that a million bitcoins may hit the market and cause costs to careen lower.**

**For now, the case remains shrouded in mystery amid the shortage of formal confirmation of his passing.**

Strike is not an wallet. It is marketing itself as an app. Think of it as a dealer who has its all LN node and an account one exchanges. Here is what it does:

+ It dominate the funds in USD to protect its user from volatility  
+ When a user fund their account with an onchain tx, consider it as a sell off on exchange. The user will have the fund as USD on their Strike app.
+ Strike users can make payments on LN for no fee as Strike already operate a LN node
+ Strike users can make onchain tx but it will be subjected to tx fees ( just like you do btc withdrawal from an exchange)

Bitcoin,How Reducing Bitcoin's Smallest Unit of Account (millisat/microsat/nanosat) Could Extend the Block Subsidy Past the 33rd Halving,"First, let me start by saying that I am no expert when it comes to Bitcoin's source code (or C++ for that matter) although I have enough experience to get a basic understanding of what's going on and am curious to see what others might think of my findings as they relate to this post.

Currently, Bitcoin's smallest unit of account is 1/100,000,000th or 0.00000001, also known as 1 satoshi. For those of you that aren't aware, this parameter is set in [src/amount.h](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/amount.h), line 14,

static const CAmount COIN = 100000000;

If we wanted to change the smallest unit of account, then all we'd have to do is change this parameter, COIN, as follows...

static const CAmount COIN = 100000000000; // for a change to millisats

static const CAmount COIN = 100000000000000; // for a change to microsats

static const CAmount COIN = 100000000000000000; // for a change to nanosats

I'm not exactly sure how updating this parameter might affect other parts of Bitcoin's source code, but this is outside the scope of this post and I'll leave that discussion to the experts (or maybe I'll tackle it in the future once I have a better understanding of Bitcoin's code in its entirety). What I would like to focus on instead is how reducing the smallest unit of account would extend the halving schedule past the well-known and ""final"" 33rd halving, which is estimated to take place around the year 2140.

In his article, [Dissecting the code responsible for the Bitcoin halving](https://ma.ttias.be/dissecting-code-bitcoin-halving/), Mattias Geniar does an excellent job explaining why, with sats as the smallest unit of account, Bitcoin will only have 33 halvings so please check out this article if you want the full explanation. In summary, in the function GetBlockSubsidy(), located in [src/validation.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.cpp#L1238-L1249), the initial block subsidy, nSubsidy, is defined as 50 BTC and converted into the smallest unit of account (sats). Then, in the next line of code, there is a clever way of calculating the current block subsidy by taking nSubsidy in its binary form and removing the same number of bits from the right side of that binary number as the number of halvings which have already occurred. So, for example...

**sats**:

The initial nSubsidy is equal to 50 \* 100,000,000 = 5,000,000,000 sats. Written in binary, we get 100101010000001011111001000000000. And now, after 3 halvings, we can calculate the current block subsidy by removing 3 bits from the right, 100101010000001011111001000000~~000~~. Converting 100101010000001011111001000000 back to its decimal form gives us 625,000,000 sats (or 6.25 BTC). Great, the code and math all checks out!

As you can see, the maximum number of possible halvings is equal to the number of bits it takes to represent the initial nSubsidy in binary form. So, with sats as our smallest unit of account, the initial nSubsidy (5 billion sats) in binary form, 100101010000001011111001000000000, only has 33 bits (go ahead...count them...I did!). Thus, after the 33rd halving, there will be no more bits to remove, ~~100101010000001011111001000000000~~, and the block reward will go to zero.

Now, let's do the same exercise but with millisats, microsats, and nanosats.

**millisats**:

The initial nSubsidy would be 50 \* 100,000,000,000 = 5,000,000,000,000 millisats, which in binary is 1001000110000100111001110010101000000000000 (43 bits). Thus, with millisats as the smallest unit of account, Bitcoin would successfully complete 43 halvings until the block reward goes to zero around the year 2180.

**microsats:**

The initial nSubsidy would be 50 \* 100,000,000,000,000 = 5,000,000,000,000,000 microsats, which in binary is 1001000110000100111001110010101000000000000 (53 bits). Thus, with microsats as the smallest unit of account, Bitcoin would successfully complete 53 halvings until the block reward goes to zero around the year 2220.

**nanosats:**

The initial nSubsidy would be 50 \* 100,000,000,000,000,000 = 5,000,000,000,000,000,000 nanosats, which in binary is 100010101100011100100011000001001000100111101000000000000000000 (63 bits). Thus, with nanosats as the smallest unit of account, Bitcoin would successfully complete 63 halvings until the block reward goes to zero around the year 2260.

One thing worth mentioning is the hard coded upper limit to the number of halvings, which is currently set to 64. I assume the reason this limit is set to 64 is because anything higher would require nSubsidy to change its data type from int64 to int128. This change is technically possible, so one could imagine a future where we simply continue shrinking the smallest unit of account and the block subsidy never actually runs out or goes to zero...it just keeps getting smaller and smaller. This could continue as long as our computers are able to work with these increasingly large initial nSubsidy integers.

Naturally, one might then ask, if the block subsidy never runs out, won't we exceed the 21 million BTC hard cap? Quite beautifully, the answer is, no! This would remain the hard cap and instead of exceeding it, we would just keep getting closer and closer to it the more we reduced the smallest unit of account. It would remain an asymptotic limit! This might actually prove to be a better policy since most of us already believe there will actually be 21 million BTC in total when in reality there will only ever be 20,999,999.97690000 BTC (assuming we stick with sats as the smallest unit of account). Ok...one last calculation below...the number of BTC that will be mined in total for each unit of account if adopted...

**sats:** 20,999,999.97690000 BTC by 2140

**millisats:** 20,999,999.99997060000 BTC by 2180

**microsats:** 20,999,999.99999995800000 BTC by 2220

**nanosats:** 20,999,999.99999999996010000 BTC by 2260

Again, as we choose to use smaller and smaller units of account, we inadvertently extend the timeframe of the block subsidy and only get closer and closer to the asymptotic limit of 21 million BTC but never actually reach it or exceed it. This could literally go on forever and we would never run out of block subsidies (not that they would be worth very much...miners would still make the majority of their revenue from transaction fees). But, to me, there's something beautiful about the idea of the block subsidies never running out (never going to zero) even as we go way into the future...possibly until the end of time. I believe the Bitcoin block subsidy, no matter how small, is part of what gives Bitcoin life and is something which, if possible, should never stop flowing.

Bitcoin,A potential future for Bitcoin based on Gold historic price movements,"Before you go \*insert angry meme face\* bUt YoU cAnT eQuAtE tWo DiFfErEnT aSseTs!, this post was not made for you so move along. This post is meant for the few of you out there that are open minded and find this unconventional analysis interesting. 

In 1980, Gold hit a peak of \~$700 before the crash and and long sideways movement. Then came another bull run up \~3x from the last peak to \~$2000 in 2011. Then Gold crashed almost 50%, moved sideways for a while, and suddenly spiked 1.5x from the previous peak.

Since 4 years ago, Bitcoin has been correlating extremely well with Gold's price movements but at a much faster rate. Bitcoin hit a peak of \~$20,000, crashed and moved sideways for a long time, went on another bull run up \~3x to \~$60,000, then crashed almost 50%. 

If we assume that Bitcoin will continue the historic Gold trend, that would mean Bitcoin will move sideways around the $30,000 - $35,000 range until the end of the year. Then a sudden spike close to the $100,000 range. Not financial advice.

Bitcoin,Why I refuse to sell: the tomato plant parable üçÖ,"Bitcoin is my only tomato plant. In fact this tomato plant is the only thing I have to eat right now. It is still young, and I am extremely hungry. 

I don't know what I'm going to eat next month. I don't know if I'll even have the energy to make the trip home to see my family. 

My plant has a few small tomatoes on it, barely edible. They would maybe get me through a couple weeks or a month, but I know I'd be better off waiting until they've reached maturity before eating them. If I can wait that long, their sustenance will keep me going for much longer. 

My plant has a few small leaves on it, should I eat them to tide me over? Skim a little off the top? No.  That would hinder my plant's ability to fully ripen, and the nourishment I'd get from its leaves isn't anywhere near that of a fully grown tomato plant. 

So I will be patient and wait until my plant has fat, red tomatoes before harvesting. And even then I'll save some of its seeds to plant each spring, giving me a bigger and bigger harvest each year. I might be late in making a trip back home to be with family, but at least I'll show up nourished from patient endurance and not emaciated from unripened opportunity.

Bitcoin,How Reducing Bitcoin's Smallest Unit of Account (millisat/microsat/nanosat) Could Extend the Block Subsidy Past the 33rd Halving,"First, let me start by saying that I am no expert when it comes to Bitcoin's source code (or C++ for that matter) although I have enough experience to get a basic understanding of what's going on and am curious to see what others might think of my findings as they relate to this post.

Currently, Bitcoin's smallest unit of account is 1/100,000,000th or 0.00000001, also known as 1 satoshi. For those of you that aren't aware, this parameter is set in [src/amount.h](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/amount.h), line 14,

static const CAmount COIN = 100000000;

If we wanted to change the smallest unit of account, then all we'd have to do is change this parameter, COIN, as follows...

static const CAmount COIN = 100000000000; // for a change to millisats

static const CAmount COIN = 100000000000000; // for a change to microsats

static const CAmount COIN = 100000000000000000; // for a change to nanosats

I'm not exactly sure how updating this parameter might affect other parts of Bitcoin's source code, but this is outside the scope of this post and I'll leave that discussion to the experts (or maybe I'll tackle it in the future once I have a better understanding of Bitcoin's code in its entirety). What I would like to focus on instead is how reducing the smallest unit of account would extend the halving schedule past the well-known and ""final"" 33rd halving, which is estimated to take place around the year 2140.

In his article, [Dissecting the code responsible for the Bitcoin halving](https://ma.ttias.be/dissecting-code-bitcoin-halving/), Mattias Geniar does an excellent job explaining why, with sats as the smallest unit of account, Bitcoin will only have 33 halvings so please check out this article if you want the full explanation. In summary, in the function GetBlockSubsidy(), located in [src/validation.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.cpp#L1238-L1249), the initial block subsidy, nSubsidy, is defined as 50 BTC and converted into the smallest unit of account (sats). Then, in the next line of code, there is a clever way of calculating the current block subsidy by taking nSubsidy in its binary form and removing the same number of bits from the right side of that binary number as the number of halvings which have already occurred. So, for example...

**sats**:

The initial nSubsidy is equal to 50 \* 100,000,000 = 5,000,000,000 sats. Written in binary, we get 100101010000001011111001000000000. And now, after 3 halvings, we can calculate the current block subsidy by removing 3 bits from the right, 100101010000001011111001000000~~000~~. Converting 100101010000001011111001000000 back to its decimal form gives us 625,000,000 sats (or 6.25 BTC). Great, the code and math all checks out!

As you can see, the maximum number of possible halvings is equal to the number of bits it takes to represent the initial nSubsidy in binary form. So, with sats as our smallest unit of account, the initial nSubsidy (5 billion sats) in binary form, 100101010000001011111001000000000, only has 33 bits (go ahead...count them...I did!). Thus, after the 33rd halving, there will be no more bits to remove, ~~100101010000001011111001000000000~~, and the block reward will go to zero.

Now, let's do the same exercise but with millisats, microsats, and nanosats.

**millisats**:

The initial nSubsidy would be 50 \* 100,000,000,000 = 5,000,000,000,000 millisats, which in binary is 1001000110000100111001110010101000000000000 (43 bits). Thus, with millisats as the smallest unit of account, Bitcoin would successfully complete 43 halvings until the block reward goes to zero around the year 2180.

**microsats:**

The initial nSubsidy would be 50 \* 100,000,000,000,000 = 5,000,000,000,000,000 microsats, which in binary is 1001000110000100111001110010101000000000000 (53 bits). Thus, with microsats as the smallest unit of account, Bitcoin would successfully complete 53 halvings until the block reward goes to zero around the year 2220.

**nanosats:**

The initial nSubsidy would be 50 \* 100,000,000,000,000,000 = 5,000,000,000,000,000,000 nanosats, which in binary is 100010101100011100100011000001001000100111101000000000000000000 (63 bits). Thus, with nanosats as the smallest unit of account, Bitcoin would successfully complete 63 halvings until the block reward goes to zero around the year 2260.

One thing worth mentioning is the hard coded upper limit to the number of halvings, which is currently set to 64. I assume the reason this limit is set to 64 is because anything higher would require nSubsidy to change its data type from int64 to int128. This change is technically possible, so one could imagine a future where we simply continue shrinking the smallest unit of account and the block subsidy never actually runs out or goes to zero...it just keeps getting smaller and smaller. This could continue as long as our computers are able to work with these increasingly large initial nSubsidy integers.

Naturally, one might then ask, if the block subsidy never runs out, won't we exceed the 21 million BTC hard cap? Quite beautifully, the answer is, no! This would remain the hard cap and instead of exceeding it, we would just keep getting closer and closer to it the more we reduced the smallest unit of account. It would remain an asymptotic limit! This might actually prove to be a better policy since most of us already believe there will actually be 21 million BTC in total when in reality there will only ever be 20,999,999.97690000 BTC (assuming we stick with sats as the smallest unit of account). Ok...one last calculation below...the number of BTC that will be mined in total for each unit of account if adopted...

**sats:** 20,999,999.97690000 BTC by 2140

**millisats:** 20,999,999.99997060000 BTC by 2180

**microsats:** 20,999,999.99999995800000 BTC by 2220

**nanosats:** 20,999,999.99999999996010000 BTC by 2260

Again, as we choose to use smaller and smaller units of account, we inadvertently extend the timeframe of the block subsidy and only get closer and closer to the asymptotic limit of 21 million BTC but never actually reach it or exceed it. This could literally go on forever and we would never run out of block subsidies (not that they would be worth very much...miners would still make the majority of their revenue from transaction fees). But, to me, there's something beautiful about the idea of the block subsidies never running out (never going to zero) even as we go way into the future...possibly until the end of time. I believe the Bitcoin block subsidy, no matter how small, is part of what gives Bitcoin life and is something which, if possible, should never stop flowing.

I've seen a couple of noobs stumble upon the abovementioned sub / websites, thinking that these resources represent BTC. Indeed, they are trying very hard to conceil the fact that they are a miniscule and unimportant part of the space trying to gain significance. However, they failed doing so over the course of the last 3-4 years.


In short, they are trying to push a fake Bitcoin clone called B.CH (I'm writing the dot because auto-mod doesn't like talk about alt-coins). If you don't know about the history of how these sites came about, google ""the hash wars"" during 2017. You'll see that a faction of people split up from Bitcoin (thank god) to roll out their own shitcoin. However, at this point, they are basically a bunch of bitter propagandists, defining their community as being ""against"" BTC, and trying to trick noobs into thinking that their fork is the ""real"" Bitcoin. 

You'll see that their main argument is that this sub is heavily cens.ored (which is true, look how ridiculous I am trying to avoid auto-deletions), but the reason for that is not to silence opposing views (we can discuss about opposing technical views here all day), but mostly to keep this sub clean (imagine what it would look like here, if moderation wasn't harsh. Ever been on Twitter?) 

In any case: STAY AWAY FROM THESE TOXIC PLACES. They operate through hate and fear and you'll learn things only from one single perspective. Do your own research. Do not trust but verify.",1624960223,ANAL-Inverter-2000,True,1,184,2021-06-29

I'll try to summarise it below:

\- The government bitcoin wallet (Chiva wallet) is a thing but any wallet will obviously work.

\- When using Chiva, they'll require some KYC data to protect the bitcoins of the user

\- Everything will be free of charge (paying, receiving and converting BTC to USD or USD to BTC).

\- They'll give 30$ in BTC to all users but those BTC will have to be spent and couldn't be converted to USD as it's not about giving money to their population but about giving an incentive to use BTC.

\- There will be 200 PoS in the country to deposit/withdraw USD on the app.

Bitcoin,"My thoughts on Bitcoin, why 1000% return in the long term","Here is my thought on how we can have a 1000% return on Bitcoin in the long run. I emphasize it is a long-term investment (at least 3-5 years) from a long-term thinking perspective, not a short-term speculation.

To counter the continual money printing, we need to buy quality assets which one of them is digital gold, Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply of 21 million units.

When comparing Bitcoin to gold, there are several big advantages.

1. Bitcoin is a digital asset and gold is physical. Meaning it is very easy to store Bitcoin, you can just download an app and store it.
2. Second, it is easy to transfer to someone else. You can use the app to do that.
3. Bitcoin can be used in a cross-border payment, you can send it to people from other countries and avoid high remittance fees without the need of a third party.

The current total market cap of gold and bitcoin are around USD 12 trillion and 0.73 trillion respectively. Both of their supplies are fixed. It is not surprising to see the total market cap of Bitcoin can catch up with gold in the long run as Bitcoin has the advantages mentioned above. If we give Bitcoin a long-term market cap of USD 12 trillion and divided by 21 million units, the long-term target price can achieve around USD 570,000, implying a 1,552% potential return from the current price of 34,500 in June 2021.

For being conservative and simple, I think it is reasonable we can at least get a 1,000% return on Bitcoin in the long run. If 1,000% return from now on, my long-term target price is 379,500. Of course, I emphasize it is a long-term investment (at least 3-5 years), not a short-term price target. Short-term price movement is affected by too many unpredictable factors which frankly I admit I cannot predict them in advance. Long-term price movement is affected by its fundamentals mainly, just like stocks.

This is a spreadsheet that I have developed for myself gradually over a few years. I have found it very helpful for keeping track of my crypto holdings (good for tax purposes). No need to trust third party apps to keep your personal information - track it yourself.

There is a lot in here;

Automatically updates prices from coingecko. The top 1000 coins included. Just select which ones you want to track by typing in the ticker symbol.

You can choose your local Fiat currency and get live conversion rates for any fiat currency.

I don't record details of every trade. Just keep track of your crypto purchases (from fiat) and what coins you currently hold. The spreadsheet will calculate the rest and keep a record of how your portfolio and holdings have changed over time (it logs this data every time you save the sheet)

Bitcoin,"In the event of the rise and fall of the bitcoin currency, what next?","After a marvelous flood in April 2021 which had permitted Bitcoin to arrive at a record worth of 64,000 dollars, its cost was divided only two months after the fact, to get back to a worth near that known in January 2021. Fantastic instability influencing numerous digital currencies, with a market capitalization that lost a fourth of its complete worth in June 2021 alone. Turns with numerous causes and results that are not just the shortcoming of Elon Musk. Causes fundamentally from China and the United States Several variables may clarify why Bitcoin, which addresses 47% of the worldwide crypto capitalization, has quite recently fallen essentially beneath the $ 30,000 edge, just to fall back to values ‚Äã‚Äãequivalent to those of January 2021 . One of them, the most genuine, comes from China. Beijing has essentially expanded the tone against crypto mining in its region in June 2021. The conventional restriction on crypto-mining in the two principle delivering regions, Xinjiang and Sichuan, presently stretched out to the entire nation, is a horrible hit to Bitcoin, which is 80% sabotaged in the Middle Kingdom. Restless, in addition to other things, to accelerate the execution of its ecological strategy, to accomplish carbon impartiality in 2060, Xi Jinping's administration isn't tarrying. Another significant reason is essentially the unpredictability of Bitcoin, which is vital as a rule and especially highlighted for the current year by Elon Musk's tweets. The last mentioned, from the United States, figured out how to consistently increment or decline the worth of Bitcoin with a basic tweet on the informal community. Profiting with the absence of guidelines of cryptos, Musk's comments, generally talking in the interest of Tesla, have at times made the cost of Bitcoin vary by 10% fifty-fifty per day. At long last, it's anything but a validity issue that impacts the cost of Bitcoin. The reception of this crypto as cash having legitimate delicate similarly as the American dollar in El Salvador doesn't pass for the World Bank and doesn't go for the increment of its worth. Moreover, as indicated by Les Echos referring to a Bank of America-Merrill Lynch study, 81% of resource directors studied in June 2021 ($ 667 billion in market capitalization gathered) consider that Bitcoin is today a monetary air pocket. . What to place lead in the wing of the crypto. Outcomes everywhere in the world The new choice of China, corresponded with the fall in the cost of Bitcoin, strikes over every one of the diggers, predominantly Chinese, who can presently don't take part in the innovative action of Bitcoin, just as another crypto. On the negative side, many positions will vanish following the conclusion of organizations spend significant time in mining. 172 000 exchanging accounts on particular stages have effectively shut since last Sunday. Another adverse consequence concerns people depending on Bitcoin exchanging to make a decent living, since the value, which tumbled to $ 26,400 on Monday, June 21, is the greater part however high as it seemed to be two months prior. Enough to create numerous frenzy deals among those generally subject to pressure, a response that won't stop the overall fall in the cost of Bitcoin, an incredible opposite. From a positive perspective, in any case, Bitcoin, which utilizes more energy, ought to decrease its carbon sway for some time. This could likewise energize considering mining that utilizes less power, conceivably through energy created more practically than as of now. the fall in the cost of Bitcoin could well progress forward a bigger scope, the developing vulnerability encompassing the fate of a crypto like Bitcoin, forthcoming answers for its mining, come off on all digital currencies. This prompts an expansion in instability, which indeed expands vulnerability about them. There is by all accounts a genuine doubt of computerized monetary forms and the ten world debuts have seen their costs fall by 18 to 25% in June alone. What's more, the dip under the mental limit of $ 30,000 for Bitcoin, notwithstanding the most recent measures from the Chinese government, implies that the fall in its cost may not stop there.

Bitcoin,3 Bitcoin/Crypto Qs by a Newbie After Reading Nakamoto's Paper rop,"1) What do people believe are the true upsides of crytocurrencies? We can use blockchains for financial transactions without using cryptocurrency. Also, Nakamoto's paper strongly suggests that the advantages of using crypto were intended for merchants and not for payers. The first paragraph of the body of his paper is devoted to how ""reversible"" financial transactions (i.e., credit card disputes, as he defines the term) are costly for merchants. The paper does not open with any mention of concerns over anonymity. 

2) Nakamoto also proposed transaction fees to offset the costs of the  tremendous CPU time and energy required for the blockchain. So, reversible transactions are too costly...but the energy consumed by cryptocurrencies annually is more than some countries like Italy consume in a year...and is expected to grow. And, it's going to be offset by...FEES? How is this a good idea or a good alternative to traditional banking? The crypto exchanges already charge a lot of transactional and other fees.

3) As we know, the crypto markets are volatile. How does that make this a good currency?",1624936237,MadeleineElstersTwin,True,1,1,2021-06-29

Bitcoin,I'm A CEO of A Small Agency in Norway and This Is Why Bitcoin Is Our Hedge Against Bad Hires,"Hello fellow hodlers. I am guessing this will be a somewhat different post, and quite the long one as well. Hope you find it interesting and a nice addition to your own confirmation bias as to why Bitcoin is and will be lifechanging. Also, thank you for reading.

# First, a couple of caviats;

\- I am not a Bitcoin OG. I didn't know about it in 2013. I hated it in 2017. I FOMOed in 2018. I was surprised in 2020. And I love and understand it in 2021.

\- I am not a financial advisor, and I am speaking on behalf of the company I own which employs just south of 20 people.

\- We don't have a massive treasury and are inexperienced as a company investing in assets and other instruments

\- English is not my mother tongue, so bear with me.

\- Fuck you Elon.

In this piece I'll do my best and explain from a small corporate perspective why accumulating Bitcoin became part of the corporate strategy and unanimously accepted by the general assembly.

# Next, some background to who we are as a company

I founded the marketing agency back in 2017 and we quickly hired alot of people and attracted great clients. Our work is a combination of video production, copywriting, graphic design, web, podcast and everything social media. Basically, we are a marketing department that our clients ""subscribe"" to for 12 months with certain limitations for a fixed price. Our projected revenue 2021 EOY is about 2,5M USD.

We are known for being provacative, experimental and the ""go-to-place"" for small B2B companies to jumpstart their marketing game.

Again, our business model is not very scalable. It's human trafficking (it's a joke!!!) - we need one guy or gal to do some work, and that work can only be done so many times in a day. If we want to do more of that work, we need to hire a new guy or gal and so on. And if you don't have BCG or McKinsey in your logo - the ability to scale on premium price is very difficult as well. The avarage profit margin in Norway in our industry is about 3-4%. Eeeew. The ""only"" way to make big buck with this kind of business model is either scale massively on people, price or both. The cost that makes up about 85% of the total, is rent for office space and labour cost, so it requires alot to make that happen. It's very risky to scale an agency business with people if you don't have alot of cash on hand - which we don't have.

We've been in business like I said since 2017 and so far we have not made a meaningful profit yet. We have OK salaries, but that's it. We are smart, creative and driven people - so the salary, even though it is OK, it is not extremely good. And we do want to create a company that can pay out significant dividends to make up for the struggle of building, running and owning a company. With current model, that seems to be a stretch medium-term.

# The Pandemic Gave Perspective On Things

Like most other places, within a week from March 9th to March 12th of 2020, the semantics went from ""yeye, I don't care"", to; ""OMFG"". It literally turned most of our business upside down and was a really chaotic experience. The unthinkable paradox happened; everyone wanted to sell something, but none wanted to buy anything. Except fucking toilet paper.

Marketing, and especially external marketing consultants, is not business critical to everyone, maybe even anyone, during a world crisis. And obviously we faced a lot of pushback from our clients. So we are grateful that most stayed with us, but some left. Leaving our business extremely volnurable as we don't have the liquidity to simply shut down.

A few months in during the pandemic, my partner told me: ""Dude, Bitcoin just hit 30k"". We had been speculating somewhat back in 2017 and found crypto to be somewhat interesting, but at the same time a piece of shit idea. And I remember thinking to myself that we were going to see another meltdown like never before with crypto. But, then I started reading about it. I read about Michael Saylor, Tesla's purchase, banks recruiting experts, ETF's trying to be accepted, Queen Cathie Woods, white papers, Cointelegraph, Bitcoin Magazine and so on. Not only that, but our very own Kjell Inge R√∏kke (one of Norway's wealthiest) just put 60 million dollars in it and started a crypto company.

I am not the smartest guy in the crypto room, but these guys are - and now I was on my journey of juggling a struggling company during the pandemic, firing bad people and also putting in the first 1000 hours of understanding Bitcoin, the money system and how this will be adopted as a revolutionary technology 5-10 years from now.

And then I realized...

# Why Bitcoin Is Not A Risky Bet (for us)

I've done several bad hires - actually a couple to many because of my own naivity. During the worst period of corona last year we knew that we had 4 bad hires in our organization. That is pretty significant as we were only 15 employees at the time.

This might be a controversial line, but hiring **bad** people is a zero-sum game in which the employee is the winner and the employer is the loser. A bad hire is the true Rat Poison Squared as the faggot would say.

Now, most of you I assume live in the US and I live in Norway. Two completely different hiring/firing laws. In Norway, you simply can't fire someone ""just because"". Making the bad hire outcome even worse, since the process of firing someone that don't create any value for the company is a tedious process - time consuming, energy draining, lawyer fees and always a ""settlement package"" including minimum 3 months of salary. I know of entrepreneur peers that simply went bankrupt because of a few bad hires early on that just dragged the process so long that the company didn't have any liquidity left. And yes, I agree that the employer has a responsibility of not making those mistakes. But, come on bro.

The point I'm trying to make here is that if you have made a bad hire; it is like watching your stock go from whatever price to 0. It literally is a 100% loss. And the chances of getting even the slightest amount of value from a bad hire is also near 0%. Bad hire bad. Good hire good.

So I thought to myself at first in winter 2021. What if we trim our agency to become a truly premium business, work on upskilling people, and invest in what we already have and add a few seniors to our team, and then re-invest the hypotethically cost of bad hires in Bitcoin? Either we double in size and go from about 20 people to 40 and making 5M revenue with 10% margin and along the way waste a shit ton of money on bad hires. Because, trust me, bad hires comes with volume in recruiting. There is no way past it.

Or we invest and accumulate Bitcoin and dream about a 10x return within the next 4-5 years with alot less company risk, governance, stress and hazzle. I liked the latter idea so much that I wanted to pursue it as a core strategy for our company and change my role from being just a ""CEO"" to Master of Coin. A fun ego boost as well.

I needed to convince the group of equity partners and also the small board we have. And I'd like to share with you guys how I did it.

Eventhough I have no experience with decentralized systems, cryptography, peer-to-peer networks, or money itself, I have enough experience with scams and empty promises to know that Bitcoin is a scam.  

I do think I am smarter than most people. Most people don't believe in Bitcoin. I , like 99% of the population, think Bitcoin is a scam and only morons would buy it. Because we are smart, we won't get scammed.  

We don't need Bitcoin because it is not backed by anything. My money is backed by a government. I can trust my government because all governments are trustworthy and never print out too much money that will devalue our currency. 

This is why house prices have been the same for the past 100 years, and are affordable for everyone. This is how my parents bought this house for us 50 years ago. Now if we sell it, we can make half a million dollars. This is thanks to the government. 

Bitcoin is backed by what? It's backed by nothing. There is no government, no bank, no institution or company behind it. It's just a bunch of computers. Computers are untrustworthy. You can't trust a computer. Computers crash. They malfunction. You can trust the government because people are more trustworthy and uncorruptable.

And don't even mention the fossil fuels used by Bitcoin itself. This is just ridiculous. I don't want to be part of that. I don't want to contribute to destroying the planet. I consider myself a person who cares and protects the planet that's why I only use electric cars and eat organic. 

Eventhough I understand poor people can't afford anything because their savings get devalued every year, I think their problems will be solved once they get a real job and work harder. Then they can retire in the house their parents bought them and contribute to our cause by getting their own electric cars.

Why do we even need to waste so much energy on Bitcoin when we have banks? Banks don't use up fossil fuels. 

I have the feeling that the Bitcoin community is just full of greedy people who only care about making money. In my opinion, and in the opinion of almost everyone I know, only greedy people would buy something like that.

I don't have any experience. And I don't care about Bitcoin. It's irrelevant to my life. I won't use it and I don't want to use it.",1624908676,kola401,True,1,88,2021-06-29

Bitcoin,BTC Showing 2 Bullish Signals,"There are two very important patterns that are playing out in the [Bitcoin chart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfOaHzcJ9IM). Lets take a closer look at these patterns and identify what they mean for the Bitcoin price.

Firstly, on the Bitcoin 1 day chart, we see a falling wedge pattern getting formed. As we know the falling wedge is a bullish pattern. Yesterday, we broke above the falling wedge and today we are treating the top line of the wedge as a support. If we can confirm it as a support, the target for Bitcoin will be approximately $40,000. But before reaching $40K, there are a lot of resistances. The first resistance is at the level of $35,000 which has been acting as a resistance for the past few days. If we break above the $35k, then the 20 day simple moving average which is at $35, 750 will act as a string resistance. If we cross above that, then the 50 day simple moving average which is at $38k approximately will be the next hurdle before reaching $40K. And once we reach $40K, the 200 day Simple moving average will be the strongest resistance.

Secondly, on the Bitcoin 4 hours chart, we see a double bottom pattern getting formed which is also a bullish pattern. The neck line for this pattern is close to $35,500 level. If we break above it, then our target could be $40,000. But, as mentioned earlier there are several resistances before we reach $40K.

Lastly, on the Bitcoin Monthly chart, we notice that the level of $30,112 is a very critical support and breaking below it can take Bitcoin price to about $20,000. So, its very important that we close this month above the aforementioned price.",1624907155,Crypto_BullsClub,True,1,0,2021-06-29

What is SENT?

SENT prioritizes community and ensures fair distribution of tokens. Token holders participate in the governance of the project from the very start, including voting on ecosystem fees, the SENT rewards program structure, how the Trade The Chain 2.0 platform will interface with the SENT token, and interfacing with a soon-to-be-announced advisory council to ensure impact resolutions are passed. Another unique part of SENT was how it first was brought to market, in a fair launch on the decentralized exchange Zero. A fair launch is when the token is floated on the open market rather than sold. There was no pre-sale or initial coin offering, the token was simply made available to the community. As sentiment continues to dictate crypto markets and more traders look for better ways to make decisions, Trade The Chain and SENT offer a unique proposition for anyone wanting to trade like a professional.
How does it work?

The platform leverages technology to parse through thousands of media and data sources in multiple languages to deliver actionable insights and one-hour price predictions across hundreds of projects and dozens of trading venues.

The team behind Trade The Chain recognized the importance of fostering the reciprocal relationship between their platform and their community, and SENT was created to engage and reward members. SENT is a multi-faceted token incentivizing holders through exclusive offers, discounts, and other exciting opportunities from Trade The Chain and its partner ecosystem.Strong Endorsement

Bitcoin.com Exchange CEO Danish Chaudhry highlights the community aspect: ‚ÄúSENT is a great example of projects putting community first. There will be several benefits to Trade The Chain members holding this token, and we‚Äôre excited to be the first launch venue.‚Äù

To celebrate listing the SENT token, Bitcoin.com Exchange is hosting a 10-day trading competition with a prize pool of $20,000 SENT, giving traders the chance to win the token and participate in the Trade the Chain community.

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Hashrate Climbs Back Above 100 EH/s, Difficulty Could Drop More Than 20% Next Week","On Saturday, Bitcoin‚Äôs SHA256 hashrate managed to climb back above the 100 exahash per second region after it slid to a low of 91 EH/s three days ago. Meanwhile, in five days the network‚Äôs mining difficulty change is approaching and it could see the difficulty drop over 20%.
Statistics show that bitcoin (BTC) miners are processing blocks a lot faster, as the hashrate has improved during the last 48 hours. On June 26, 2021, the network‚Äôs hashrate jumped back above the 100 EH/s zone.
The hashrate fell to 91 EH/s on June 23, 2021, following the crackdowns in China stemming from five Chinese provinces with the most recent being Sichuan. Between then and over the last three days, the hashrate has increased 9-13%The next mining difficulty drop is expected to happen in five days and at current processing power, it could drop around 20.57%. At the time of writing, the network‚Äôs mining difficulty is 19.93 trillion and the change could bring it to 15.83 trillion next week.
Bitcoin‚Äôs mining difficulty is essentially the measurement of how difficult it is to find a hash below a given target. When Bitcoin‚Äôs hashrate is high, the difficulty will increase, and when the hashrate drops like it did after China‚Äôs crackdown, the mining difficulty will drop lower. Therefore making it easier and harder to mine BTC with every fluctuation. Bitcoin‚Äôs network difficulty changes every 2,016 blocks or roughly every two weeks.

The top five bitcoin (BTC) mining pools on June 26, 2021, include Antpool, F2pool, Viabtc, Binance Pool, and Poolin. Those five mining pools capture 62.83% of the Bitcoin hashrate, while the rest is processed by 11 known pools and a 7.49% portion of mystery hashrate.
The next difficulty change seems to be pointing toward the largest mining difficulty drop in 2021 thus far. The network did see the largest difficult rise in 2021, with an approximate 21.53% increase, at block height 683,424 on May 13.",1624905423,JonathanNash3sfC,True,1,4,2021-06-29

So my conspiracy would be China has a hidden store of miners, not being used.. They force all the privately owned miners to leave or face the wrath of Xi! Then once the difficulty tanks, they can more easily double spend or cause other forks/havoc. 

They would still need a lot of horse power, but BTC hash is down almost 50% from the peak, and those miners are somewhere, just not ""turned on"".

Bitcoin,Why can't the block size scale along the real world like mining difficulty can?,"Mining difficulty can adapt to major world events that lower or increase the total processing power, so one block always takes about 10 minutes to mine. So if the world on average gets better hardware the difficulty increases, or if a whole country all of the sudden had to stop mining, decreasing the world wide Bitcoin processing power in the process, the difficulty will decrease. 

Why isn't the block size adaptable as well? In the past decade mining difficulty has increased orders of magnitude because Moore's law etc. But Moore's law also affects storage and bandwidth cost, so the price per block was considerably more expensive back in the day than it costs now, on every continent of the world, yet the block size doesn't scale with it.

Even if it scaled with the slowest technologically advancing country on earth, even for them 1mb in 2009 was more expensive than it is today. And if it scaled at such a slow rate, you wouldn't run into centralization issues, since for the vast majority of the world it would still get cheaper per block, since the cost per mb lowers more than the increase in block size.",1624897232,Decapitated_Tomato,True,1,86,2021-06-29

In this same timespan do you believe you have the same opportunity to set aside funds into the next other great thing that could have yielded you a great fortune?  Surely 5K was worth it to buy Amazon in 2004 and hold till today. What makes you think that Bitcoin is any different? Except, it makes no sense to value what you are intending to escape from. We're not going to value bitcoin in bananas because that's hardly fungible.  

I say this to tell you, fret not, your goal should be to go for a couple bitcoin and end it there, more than that is both hard and discouraging against yourself.  You can reach this goal of a couple bitcoin if you dedicate yourself to the cause.  You'll be in a better position than any millionaire because you're setting yourself up for an exit out of the oppression caused from bad policy inflicted by inept governments with individuals who would rather keep the status quo going with their jobs and bonuses and twitter engagement lip service but no actual work nor resolve for the public at large.",1624896907,frankenmint,True,1,8,2021-06-29

Bitcoin,The next difficulty adjustment period is going to have a crappy rate too.,"The hashrate has dropped a LOT in just the last couple of days.  Even two days ago, it was at (just) over 75% of the ""six blocks per hour"" target level.  Now it's at 72%, and with the Chinese end-of-the-month deadline for shutting off power to mining farms, it will drop further in the next two days.

Only problem is, this comes right at the end of a mining period that should already have been over -- we're already five days behind, and the difficulty drop is only going to be about 75%.  This continued drop in hashrate is hitting at a time when it's going to have less effect than needed to accurately retarget difficulty.  So next ""epoch"" will continue to be sluggish.

If you've got an old mining rig, this is going to be a good period to crank it up again.

If you want to send a transaction, you're probably going to be better off doing it now rather than later.  If it's important to you, either don't try to scalp the fee, or use RBF so you can resend it at a higher fee later.

2) Don't ever buy btc with credit or debit card because their fee's are insanely high( around 3.49%),instead use your bank account for funding

3) Increase your knowledge everyday,but not through some random guy on YouTube who guarantees that your money will be doubled by some of his secret tips. Instead read books,which give you complete information and most importantly the correct information. Personally,I've just finished reading 'Bitcoin for Dummies' and I loved it,it explains all the complex financial terms with ease.

That was all! Hope somebody who's just starting out in btc finds this helpful haha and as always,tips and advices are appreciated :)",1624895026,prajit21,True,1,2,2021-06-28

Bitcoin,The Bankers are afraid of Bitcoin and Change it Brings. So They Spout FUD SPIN &amp; LIES about Bitcoin Energy Use.,"In Iceland Bitcoin mining monetises  surplus geothermal output overnight and offpeak when  it would otherwise  be wasted. In Canada, Alaska and until recently  Sichuan and Mongolia  surplus hydro output has been monetised via Bitcoin  mining- hydro water  reserves which would otherwise be dumped unused  have been given value  via Bitcoin mining thus lowering the cost of  overall production and  lowering the cost of these renewables to other  consumers.

The  same approach can be applied to  solar and wind outputs seasonally and  daily where surplus to grid  demand can be monetisied via Bitcoin mining.

The   MSM banker FUD that Bitcoin is not environmentally responsible is BS spin. Bitcoin mining can in fact make most renewable energy  generation systems MORE viable, efficient and profitable and thereby  deliver lower cost renewable power to businesses and consumers by  conveniently monetising surplus electricity production that would  otherwise be wasted.

How much of  most industrial applications are currently powered by  100% renewable  electricity? Are Teslas build and recharged with 100%  renewable  electricity? The banks use 2x more electric  than  Bitcoin. Gold mining uses 2x more energy than Bitcoin  mining...probably  mostly diesel!

But ask a democracy advocate from an authoritarian regime about money, and they will tell amazing and tragic stories. Demonetization in Eritrea and North Korea, hyperinflation in Zimbabwe and Venezuela, state surveillance in China and Hong Kong, frozen payments in Belarus and Nigeria, and economic firewalls in Iran and Palestine. And now: monetary colonialism in Togo and Senegal. Without financial freedom, movements and NGOs cannot sustain themselves. If their bank accounts are shuttered, notes demonetized or funds debased, their power is limited and tyranny marches on.""

China has openly stated it objects to  the USD$ SWIFT &amp; CHIPS global banking system hegemony which enables  the USA to have considerable power by placing banking sanctions on  nations or entities the US does not approve of. Therefore China has  stated DCEP is intended to enable an alternative means of payment  outside of the USD$ SWIFT &amp; CHIPS hegemony...and DCEP may  well  enable this...if it does the USA potentially loses huge strategic and  economic power. The USA today and for the last 50 years has not enjoyed  trade surpluses but has financed chronic trade deficits via the  seigniorage it enjoys as the creator of the global reserve currency.  USAs massive debt pile approaching $30 trillion is only viable as long as the  USA continues to gain seigniorage via its reserve currency issuance.

If  China, which expects to become the largest economy on the planet within  the next 10 years requires trading partners to settle imports and  exports via the much more efficient DCEP system rather than the US$ who  could object? If this happens the USA is bankrupt.

At the  same time Bitcoin is now established as an alternative to both the US$  and DCEP. Bitcoin stands outside of any direct nation state or private  entities monitoring, control or debasement.

Bitcoin treats all people equally without fear or favour.

Bitcoin alone provides an alternative to Chinas Autocracy and the USAs fiat debt slavery.

DCEP vs US$ vs BTC

What  does everyone think about the future of money and the looming contest  between China and the USA to control the world via monetary hegemony?

I have only tried the iOS wallet, and it's the best wallet and interface I've ever had.

It supports pretty much all currencies. It's a pretty user interface with ERC20 tokens lined up under Ethereum, the Tron Smart Contracts under Tron and Binance under Binance.  


I haven't met an asset it doesn't support. This is a just a picture of the wallet in software mode, hence the zero amount.

It also holds NFT's if you're into that. It's a very nice UI full of features.

Bitcoin,The First Bank In Mexico Is About to Start Accepting Bitcoin,"Ricardo Salinas Pliego, the third richest man in Mexico, said that he wants his bank to be the first one in Mexico to accept Bitcoin. We heard about lots of banks that already have started to work with crypto, and BTC in particular. The main difference with this case is that Ricardo Salinas Pliego actually believes that BTC is a real equivalent of gold, and that fiat currencies in fact are a fraud. He says that the most significant feature of BTC is the fact that it has a total supply, which cannot be said about any fiat currency.

Bitcoin,On route to 0.1 is this enough for general purpose?,"I don‚Äôt have much money and I‚Äôm trying to improve and the possibility of having a slightly better quality of life by taking small amounts of cash I can afford to lose but placing them in different assets. I won‚Äôt be able to go much above 0.1 of a coin (if at all) but if bitcoin become widely accepted do you think this is enough for the average person?

My plan is to get 0.1 of a coin by 2022 and then hold this amount for the future and then move my spare investment money that I would spend buying Bitcoin to the next investment (get a mortgage - no more spare cash to get Bitcoin) Would 0.1 of a coin be enough as a baseline to own for the future etc?

I have a few reservations with Bitcoin, particularly the fees that exchanges charge etc. It seems like there is a push to make Bitcoin 1 world currency, and people seem to want it to be controlled via exchanges who charge? 

It‚Äôs seems like it‚Äôs almost a perfect way to implement a 1 world currency with the exchanges holding all the coins and charging us to use it (which sounds eerily like our current banking system) only now digital and easily removed / banned / locked out etc. We have huge companies and whales owning thousands of coins therefore equality is not something that can be achievable via Bitcoin, we will have extreme wealth and those without (poor) it seems to me that Bitcoin is a great concept but the people are corrupting it via hoarding, creating exchanges (central bank) that charges your for its use (eventually they will own vast amounts via charges) for others to get coin they will need to ‚Äúloan‚Äù coon from a whale or an exchange and possibly pay back interest?

It seems like ‚Äúwe the people‚Äù are pushing Bitcoin into a very similar corner as our current financial system and billionaires, exchanges, those without etc which does (rightly or wrongly) set alarm bells ringing in my head.

Reading posts of people saying ‚Äúthose who don‚Äôt invest can suffer‚Äù, ‚Äúboomers can be left out on the cold‚Äù does not lead me to think this is what/how/why Bitcoin was created. I initially thought it was that everyone would get Bitcoin and we would create an equality where it would be traded for services and skills etc. 

Now it seems people are trading it, using it for gains in fiat, mocking others who arnt invested and has a lot of toxicity and hostility in the area a.

it seems like bitcoin has been games and corrupted and it‚Äôs vision distorted by greed, people trying to buy it all to get rich? That was never the point of the intent of Bitcoin, in fact it was the entire polar opposite! It was about financial freedom and equality but it seems greed has infected it.

With my concerns aside, do you think 0.1 is enough to own as a base line (just in case) or what do you think is a safe amount to own as a base line for the future of Bitcoin, not to be rich, but enough to have as a useful safe equal amount?",1624880496,BitznPeasez,True,1,58,2021-06-28

Even tweets of Musk don't regularly change the price. Even some government news don't change the price substantially (e.g El Salvador accepting bitcoins or China bans of mining). 

So why there is a steady and fast growth of the price and then a fast decline? Many people and organizations that I know that bought crypto do not withdraw it to fiat money but rather hold it, so there should not be a huge supply of  Bitcoin.

Bitcoin,Can Bitcoin implement H's Wealth Formula? Taproot?,"Can bitcoin do this?!

Âçê Hitler's Wealth Formula Âçê 
https://hitlermoon.net

Ever wonder why Hitler chose the swastika, the symbol of PROSPERITY, as his emblem?!
He wanted to make everybody rich!

Bolshevik financiers who want you to stay poor tried to suppress the truth about Hitler's Wealth Formula. They destroyed the Third Reich so that the Formula couldn't liberate the world from the shackles of poverty. Bolsheviks thought they got him, but Hitler and his most loyal followers escaped to the Moon and turned it into world's wealthiest economy - the Fourth Reich.

He was waiting for the right time to try to recapture planet Earth... and now with the power of decentralization, nobody can stop Hitler. He will share the Formula with the whole world! He WILL make YOU rich!

Wernher von Braun and Adolf Hitler translated Hitler's Wealth Formula into an Ethereum decentralized exchange smart contract, HitlerSwap, that guarantees everyone 1000x returns on investments in Fourth Reich's official currency - HitlerMoon!

How does it work? We block all the Bolshevik exchanges from ever interacting with HitlerMoon. You can only trade HitlerMoon on HitlerSwap and Hitler's Wealth Formula guarantees the price will NEVER EVER go down. It can ONLY GO UP! All trades on HitlerSwap are executed in harmony with Hitler's Wealth Formula ensuring everyone can get a 1000x return!

Holders of more than 10,000 HitlerMoon can convert their tokens into a Fourth Reich citizenship. If the last 2 bytes of the blockhash are 8 and 8 when selling your stake you will get a free ticket to go to the moon and visit the Fourth Reich.

After 1 year everybody will be rich and Hitler will let financiers back in just to show you how right he was about them!

Bitcoin,Do you think in the future most households will put more than 5% of their earnings into bitcoin?,"When you look at the US inflation, it is almost hard to believe. In 2020, your $1,000 is actually worth $1,040.12 in 2021 money due to the 4.99% inflation. This is calculated by BLS and uses the consumer price index. 

To put in a 20 year context, your $1,000 back in 2000 has the same buying power of $1,563.27 today. But if you left it in the bank and collected a tiny interest over time, your actual money has depreciated over the decades. For other countries like the UK, their inflation is actually worse. ¬£1,000.00 in 2000 would be equivalent to ¬£1,726.63 in 2021. 

Rather than having your fiat currency in the bank, wouldn't it make more sense just to store it in bitcoin? For people planning on retiring for the next 20 years, aren't you worried about the rapid inflation in your currency?

Bitcoin,Bitcoin and spiritual regression: an unexpected link,"More or less randomly, I stumbled upon some documentary about 'spiritual regression'.

This can be described as a way which - supposedly - allows you to access memories of your past life/lives (implying reincarnation).

I am scientifically minded but I also accept that there is so much we don't know about the very nature of ourselves and the universe in which we happen to live.

So, I was thinking: let's suppose for a moment that reincarnation -  or something similar - is real. What would that imply?

Being bitcoin what it is - an asset which you fully own by simply 'knowing' something (private-key / seed) - then bitcoin would also be the only asset that you can easily 'leave to yourself' in your next life/lives.

You would 'just' need to see/remember the seed (again), for example with the help of spiritual regression.

Thinking about other kind of assets, it would be extremely difficult to (re)acquire them in your next life, because it would be almost impossible to prove your 'property rights' on them (and everything would have been inherited by your 'old' relatives).

Bitcoin is different: knowing the seed is enough 'proof' (but this can work only if you didn't leave the seed to your relatives).

If this is true, and BTC someday becomes the world's reserve currency, replacing the 200 trillion dollars of currency in circulation around the world, that would imply that the final value of one BTC could be as much as around 10 million dollars, nominally speaking, in today's money.

Which would make each sat worth about a dime.

And of course the shrinkage, while I'm sure it's slowed dramatically as BTC has increased in value, hasn't stopped altogether. And even after it arrives at its final destination, and even if that destination is 10 million usd, it won't stop even then. Even if BTC replaces all other currency, the deflation, although slowed, will never stop.

Those are kind of sobering thoughts. And that's also assuming that its evolution from this point forward is smooth. While I'm very optimistic about BTC's ultimate success, I think a big part of that success will be surviving yet another global financial crisis, which I believe will be far worse than the first one. I believe BTC could suffer horribly in the short term during such an event, but recover dramatically when hyperinflation of fiat currencies finally sets in. I could easily see a scenario in which a global financial crash brought BTC to its knees, and cause the world to think it had failed. In such an event, we could see key loss like never before, even worse than the development phase when people took few precautions to protect them.

So ultimately it's anyone's guess how much value a single BTC could have. But it would seem that 10 million in today's dollars is a good conservative estimate, in the event that it eventually became the universal reserve for the world.

I write this as a word of encouragement, but also as one of warning. Along with the standard advice of not investing more than you're willing to lose, I would add to that, if such a time comes when people think BTC is dead, that may be your signal to guard those keys more tightly than ever before. Even if it returns to .10 per BTC, you continue to protect that BTC as if it were worth 10 million, because if hyperinflation kicks in, it could literally go from .10 to 10 million dollars in only a few short months.",1624826317,thorosaurus,True,1,101,2021-06-28

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin, daily hash rate, future energy consumption and the lightning network","Dear knowledgable bitcoiners,  


I love simulation modelling, and I've been playing around with a model to get a better understanding of Bitcoin and its energy consumption. Basically, I used this scientific paper as a starting point: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09212](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09212). I then added some small components to simulate historical energy consumption of the Bitcoin network, and compared my results to the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index ([https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption)).   


Here are the historical simulation results (simulation starting at 9th of july 2016  and running in days):   


[Bitcoin Energy Consumption from 9th of july 2016 to early june 2021 ](https://preview.redd.it/hlr3gw6r7v771.jpg?width=478&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64103052c843370a0099c9145900c289e6706911)

I then started playing around a little. I ran a simulation going about 20 years ahead while assuming the following:  
\- Daily number of transactions will remain constant at 250 k per day  
\- Transaction fee per transaction remain constant at todays level (measured in BTC)  
\- The energy efficiency of mining hardware also stays constant at todays level  
\- The electricity prices stay constant at todays level  
\- The price of bitcoin increases 5% per year.   


This is what I got:   


[Bitcoin Energy Consumption from 9th of july 2016 to somewhere about june 2041](https://preview.redd.it/8xl8wpyf8v771.jpg?width=489&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a3a518313080a8d9d31609e79687a433f20f89)

  
I then realized that the miners are mostly incentivized by the built-in subsidy right now. In fact, my model estimates that bitcoin miners would only consume about 15 TWH per year if it wasnt for the built-in subsidiy. Due to the halving events, the incentives for mining will go down over time following the next halving as long as the bitcoin price does not increase by more than 50% per 4-ish year period.  At least according to my model... 

Having realized that, I came to think about the lightning network. Someone told me that the lightning network will basically bundle a lot of transactions such that it becomes only one transaction on the network. This had me wondering, what will happen to the future hash rate if LN bundle a lot of transactions in one transaction, and the block rewards go down significantly? Won't it become much less profitable with mining? Will the network still be secure in a setting where the hash rate is very low?

Bitcoin,Am I 100% doing this Coldcard thing right?,"Upon receiving it, I updated and verified the firmware, and it has been 100% airgapped ever since. I use a 9v battery to power it, have not plugged it into a computer, and it hasn't had an SD card since the firmware update.

It's for long term storage and is to remain 100% airgapped. Bitcoin goes in and doesn't come back out again until time to buy moon lambo.

After updating the firmware, I generated test wallets by throwing dice, and verified them using the python script from their website. After being confident that it was faithfully encrypting the dice throws, I generated my actual seed, which I of course didn't verify, but backed up by engraving the 24 word seed on stainless steel.

I then sent a thousand in BTC to the first address listed in the address explorer on the device, after which I wiped the seed and restored it using the backup I had engraved, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes recording it. The restored wallet showed the same receive addresses in the address explorer.

I'm now sending small amounts to subsequent addresses in the address explorer, in order.

The only thing I haven't done is test sending BTC out of the wallet, since that would require breaking my airgap. Which leads to my main question.

Are there any possible mistakes, errors in firmware, etc. at this point that could still mean losing the BTC I send to this wallet? Or am I 100% good to go and have nothing to worry about?",1624823950,thorosaurus,True,1,31,2021-06-28

Bitcoin,Bitcoin critisism,"I look for criticism and I am pro bitcoin, I have to say its hard to
find proper arguments against bitcoin on this reddit. I see manly
negative news articles about some regulation and other news that seem
bad for btc. But no fundamental discussion. What I found so far are these:

1) Price is to volatile, or It has no guaranteed value and it's a bubble
2) It's not accepted yet and you can't pay in most shops
3) It faces harsh drawbacks from government/the people who do not want
to give away their power of printing money, so they will somehow stop it.

4) There are thousands of coins out there = inflation. I deem that not
to be true since every POW system that has a smaller hashrate that
bitcoin is theoretically ""hackable"" by the hashingpower provided by the
btc miners, plus compare the hashing power to any other network or
supercomputer in the world, do the math yourself, it's not that hard)


I myself find some aspects not good, like that it will - if it succeeds - change or party crash the economy. Like there is not so much incentive to spend the money or btc now when (in btc terms) there is almost no Inflation. (Which in my opinion would make a positive impact on the enviroment since people won't waste their money on useless and short-lived products)
The environmental standpoint of course, but all the energy goes directly into the cryptographic security and the immutability btc offers (not security in terms of $ - that's just determined by supply and demand) so it makes it more resilient to being hacked wich ich almost impossible.
It's just like an unbiased accounting system in my eyes. Though you have to compare it to the traditional banking system with all those buildings and ATMs running around the clock and whatever else the banking system needs.

I would love to hear some constructive criticism, for me personally it seems like a system that will (at what price however, probably going up) continue to exist.",1624821829,Particular_Wafer6558,True,1,18,2021-06-28

I've also noticed that the cars in my area are very expensive, new vehicles are now priced at 27,000-39,000. These are new Kias, Hondas and Toyotas in San Francisco dealerships. Five years ago, prices for these same vehicles ranged from 18,000 to 26,000. 

The US dollar annual inflation rate is now 5%. I know that the US dollar is still better than other countries but the cost of living has risen and the wages haven't climbed very much. With bitcoin, I see my dollar's worth appreciating. I trust in bitcoin, despite its market volatility, its overall value seems to be climbing every year.

We launched a web app for the Bitcoin Lightning Network community about 24 hours ago. The news received [many retweets](https://twitter.com/BTC_LN/status/1408787662207557637) and likes on Twitter, and lots of positive feedback [on the LN subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/lightningnetwork/comments/o8bqjw/join_a_ring_of_fire_for_incoming_liquidity_on/). I was encouraged to post the site here as well:

[https://lightningnetwork.plus](https://lightningnetwork.plus/)

The web app allows lightning network node operators organize liquidity swaps (aka rings of fire). The main benefit is that for every channel you open, you also receive an incoming channel, thus you double your node's capacity and you allow yourself outgoing and incoming capacity at once.

The idea is not new. Node operators have been organizing these swaps for quite a while on forums and on telegram. This web app just makes it easier to do it. It holds your hand throughout the process so even new node operators can benefit from the concept.

The next step is the most interesting. We will have an API to this LN+ engine and database, and thus wallets can plug into it. From a user's perspective this will mean they can click a button, provide a capacity and they will automatically be matched to a triangle, the outgoing and incoming channels will be open automatically as well. In result they will have both incoming and outgoing capacity at once. This would make using LN easier, and will also decentralize and strengthen the network further. LN nodes will be organized into mega structures of multiple triangles. A mesh rather than a spokes and wheel topology.",1624814604,BTC_LN,True,1,16,2021-06-28

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Elliott Waves,"Ok, so here is my shot for BTC right now.

A bit difficult to explain, but I'll do my best.

It looks like we are heading to the end of wave 3. With the next rally up being the fifth wave of wave 3, in an impulsive 5 wave structure yet to come.

Where we are now? 

From 13 March 2021 being the top of wave 5 of 5 of 3 of 3 (damn), to 25 april 2021, we can see a 3-3-5 wave structure, making the yellow (A) wave. Then, to 10th May 2021 a 3-3-3 wave structure making the wave (B), and finally to 19 may 2021 a 3-3-5 wave structure developing the wave (C). From that point until now, we can see possibly a finished ABC to the upside making the blue wave (A), and developing maybe a 5-3-5 wave structure down to blue (B) wave.

What can we expect?

If this last movement, in effect, is an ABC, we could see a 3 waves down, and then 3 or 5 waves up to complete a higher degree ABC (blue ABC) up, and then, a 3-3-5 movement down (more time consuming) or hopefully, an impulsive 5 wave structure down to finish the wave 4 of 3 of 3.

This is not a financial advice. This is just my thoughts on the Elliott Waves Theory. Im not Elliott, I could be wrong. Please let me know what you see on the charts! :)

They could easily block any purchase of Bitcoin (or other cryptos) by taking the position that it goes against their fiat currency, environmental interests, etc... or whatever.

&gt; ""Financial watchdog ""bans"" crypto exchange Binance from UK""
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 	The UK‚Äôs financial watchdog has ordered Binance to stop all regulated activities in Britain and imposed stringent requirements in a stinging rebuke of one of the world‚Äôs biggest cryptocurrency exchanges.
&gt; 
&gt; The intervention by the Financial Conduct Authority in recent days is one of the most significant moves any global regulator has made against Binance, a sprawling digital asset firm with subsidiaries around the world. The exchange has until Wednesday evening to confirm it has complied with the watchdog‚Äôs demands, and removed its advertising.
&gt; 
&gt; The intervention is a sign of how regulators are cracking down on the cryptocurrency industry over concerns relating to its potential role in illicit activities such as money laundering and fraud, and over often weak consumer protection.
&gt; 
&gt; The FCA also this weekend issued a consumer warning against both the Cayman Islands-registered Binance holdings company and Binance Markets Limited, a London-based affiliate that is controlled by chief executive Changpeng Zhao and is overseen by the UK regulator.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúBinance Markets Limited is not permitted to undertake any regulated activity in the UK,‚Äù the FCA said, adding, ‚Äúno other entity in the Binance Group holds any form of UK authorisation, registration or licence to conduct regulated activity in the UK.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; The group did not immediately respond to a FT request for comment, but has previously said it ‚Äútakes its compliance obligations very seriously and is committed to following local regulator requirements wherever we operate‚Äù.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Binance Markets Limited is not approved under the FCA‚Äôs cryptocurrency registration regime, which is required for UK groups offering digital asset services.
&gt; 
&gt; The entity had applied to become a registered cryptocurrency company with the regulator, but pulled that application last month according to two people familiar with the situation. The watchdog confirmed the application had been dropped ‚Äúfollowing intensive engagement from the FCA‚Äù.
&gt; 
&gt; The FCA‚Äôs focus in deciding whether or not to approve such applications is based on a review of controls and practices to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
&gt; 
&gt; Binance is one of the most important operators in the fast-emerging crypto market, offering a wide range of services to customers around the world, including trading in dozens of digital coins, futures, options, stock tokens, as well as savings accounts and lending. It recorded crypto trading volumes equivalent to $1.5tn last month, according to data from TheBlockCrypto.
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; As part of the FCA‚Äôs actions, the regulator ordered Binance to display by next Wednesday on its website that, ‚ÄúBINANCE MARKETS LIMITED IS NOT PERMITTED TO UNDERTAKE ANY REGULATED ACTIVITY IN THE UK.‚Äù Binance Markets Limited also must ‚Äúsecure and preserve all records and/or information‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ. relating to all UK consumers from its systems‚Äù and halt any advertising and financial promotions.
&gt; 
&gt; Binance Markets Limited was established a year ago as part of a plan by the broader group to launch a UK-focused exchange, Binance UK, which would have been ‚Äúring fenced‚Äù from the wider global operation, according to public documents and the two people familiar with the matter. Although the FCA has restricted Binance from offering services in the UK, British citizens can still access Binance‚Äôs services in other jurisdictions.
&gt; 
&gt; London-based Binance Markets Limited had permission from the FCA to provide consumers with investment services in traditional currencies, something Binance achieved by purchasing a financial company that was already registered with the regulator. The transaction was approved by the FCA last June, according to public documents.
&gt; 
&gt; The FCA‚Äôs decision comes after Japan‚Äôs Financial Services Agency warned last week that Binance was conducting unauthorised trade in cryptocurrencies with Japanese citizens. It is the second time the FSA has warned about Binance after publishing an identical notice in 2018.
&gt; 
&gt; Germany‚Äôs financial watchdog warned investors in April that Binance had probably violated securities rules over its launch of trading in stock tokens, something the exchange tried unsuccessfully to appeal against.

https://preview.redd.it/7qekygro0s771.png?width=593&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7f56909eee7a5a6a56d164253e027cdbd683026

&amp;#x200B;

Isn't  on-chain data not the full universe of transactions? 

&amp;#x200B;

  for eg. Example 1: we have 10 users each holding one distinct BTC address. They all use Binance CEX (Centralized exchange)  to buy/sell BTC. once they deposit their BTC into Binance CEX and start buying /selling BTC, the trail does dark as these Transactions are not on-chain meaning we don't see their UTXO created prices and realised prices. 

 Example 2: Similar to Example 1 , but instead of depositing BTC, they deposit Fiat (USD) in Binance CEX to buy BTC. any buy/sell txns are on CEX so on chain data does not actually capture each user's realised Profit and Loss 

&amp;#x200B;

How do we then account for these user's (as per example) Unrealized Profit and Loss if we don't see their on-chain behavior since all the trading they do is on a CEX ??",1624785874,becks0303,True,1,3,2021-06-27

Bitcoin,FOMO as a 15-year-old.,"I'm a teenager from Singapore. At this age, I'm not legally allowed to administrate a business or invest so I just try to grasp as much acknowledge as I can. Be it finishing 2 investing books a week or using my paper trading account to test out new strategies. I also recently started a finance blog site.

 $BTC is getting so much press nowadays and is popular than ever. This gets me tremendous FOMO every time as it's gonna take me 4 MORE YEARS to really get started with investing. I've begged my parents several times for a custodial account but I'm in 10th grade and it's a very crucial year as I've got exams on the way so I'm unable to get a custodial account.

 Right now, I just have 2 income sources. 8 months ago, I tried flipping a guitar for a profit (I produce music too, so I've got a good knowledge about music instruments)  and made 80% profit.

I created a snowball effect with this and reached from $200 (saved up pocket money) to $6K just off flipping.

I recently also started a [finance blog site](https://www.affordassets.com/blog/) and that pretty much sums up my ""income streams"".

Today $ 1 USD = 3,179,435.00 Bolivar. Unlike other countries, Venezuela has actually embraced bitcoin because their national currency is worthless. 

Countries like China are trying to restrict bitcoin through crackdowns, though it is not illegal to possess it. They consider converting the yuan to bitcoin money laundering which is a criminal charge that can land people in prison. They are actually all in for blockchain technology, but only a central banked coin issued by the CCP.

Bitcoin,Time: the future of money," 

Hello ,

I've created this project inspired by the work of Einstein , Satoshi Nakamoto and the movie In time . a combination of a meme and a serious project to make Time a universal currency.

Official Time on mainnet : [https://time.market](https://www.time.market/)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/goznsg1ifp771.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad5624847b4f96d50933238bea847d9ee1889d7b

What is $TIME?

Inspired by the movie ""In Time"" , Time has become the universal currency, transferred directly between people or stored in ""time capsules"" ( wallets )

How ?

Time-keepers distribute TIME Every one elapsed day ( 86400 sec ).

They are incentivized by every second after a day expires. It's not about how much resources they use to mine but by how much incentive they may lose

Once the Time is distributed, the crowd can buy it from the Time Bank ( the time source ) then traded in secondary markets.",1624755174,mr-tamokoto,True,1,0,2021-06-27

Bitcoin,Use this crash/correction to level up,"This correction/crash period (whatever you make of it) may be the last or next to last (if you catch a break) opportunity for many of you to be to own 1 whole Bitcoin throughout your lifetime. Given the current positive trends regarding Bitcoin (institutions, financial elites and governments of small countries warming up to it) despite the China and Elon nonsense, I and many others project the adoption/desirability of Bitcoin as well as the (fiat) price of 1 Bitcoin to skyrocket within the next 5-10 years. By that point, you will have entered a small elite of super wealthy individuals who got there because they took a risk today; owning 1 BTC will put you in not be in the top 1% financially, but top 0.1%. 

It's only a matter of time before the current financial system (which is currently creaking off of the legacy reputation of the United States and US Dollar) grinds to a halt during this crisis period and we have to reinvent it entirely. I imagine the reinvention of the financial system will be one based on a digital currency that is limited in quantity and that no single government controls, with Bitcoin being the prime candidate.

We want new people interested in BTC and crypto and if they all believe this is going to dip, they won‚Äôt enter the market and‚Ä¶. The correction/dip will continue. We need buying pressure, not selling. Wouldn‚Äôt you rather have everyone going in now, in the low-to-mid $30,000s and just keep buying as it continues to stay sideways or go up? When we start hitting all-time highs, are you really going to care that you bought at $25k vs $30k?

$65k to $30k is the dip. Start buying and stop talking about the hypothetical lower price you‚Äôre going to buy at. Some broken record advice‚Ä¶ DCA. Invest 1/52nd of what you want to invest in total every week. And if that dip comes that you‚Äôve been waiting for‚Ä¶ stop the DCA strategy and and back up the truck to buy as much as you want.

When the price of bitcoin goes down significantly and the borrower has no money or feels pressured, the borrower then has to sell all of their bitcoin.

Bitcoin,Thoughts about market environment,"We are in a bear market and it will probably take a few rocky months until we see a rally, maybe towards the end of the year. 

Reasons: (1) Many people are shifting from saving to consuming as the pandemic is slowing down and life as we knew it is coming back. (2) China banning itself from Bitcoin is a big deal. If you believe that the value of Bitcoin is strongly related to the number of users and the network effect, a ban of 1.5bn users means that the value of Bitcoin has to decrease. (3) China banning miners is also a big deal. Less miners means that the hashrate/difficulty decreases and the network becomes less secure, therefore decreasing its value. (4) The narrative of this bull market was institutional investors and the ‚Äúwall of money‚Äù coming in, but the ESG component of Bitcoin was underestimated.

I think China‚Äôs ban of BTC is ultimately a strategic move to position the digital yuan as the new world reserve currency. We might see a new digital ‚Äúcold war‚Äù with Bitcoin as reserve currency of the free world and  government CDBCs in autocratic regimes.

I‚Äôm still very bullish on BTC and the crypto market, but it could take a while until the market recovers. Mining will move to US and other locations and will be cleaner, settling up for a new bull run.

Bitcoin,Blockchain.com Scammed Me...,"don't use blockchain.com. so this is my story with blockchain :

on  December 22, 2020, I mistakenly deleted the Google Authenticator app from my phone and couldn't recover it, and unfortunately, I lost my Blockchain Exchange account 2Fa 

when I realized that, I immediately requested blockchain to reset my 2Fa

they said you can reset it with your 2Fa backup code or verifying yourself by taking a photo from yourself holding these informations:  

1. Today's date;
2. Today's BTC price;
3. A handwritten text ""*2FA reset for the Blockchain.com Exchange"";*
4. Email Address registered to your Blockchain Exchange account;
5. Your full name, address and date of birth.

Since I didn't have my 2fa back up I was forced to verify myself.

In summary, I end up sending my information and verify myself but there was a problem, some of my information when signing up was fake because blockchain wasn't supporting my country 

but on January 13, 2021, they ended up accepting my verification and they answered me with this message :

https://preview.redd.it/gff0si0uln771.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b832555e07bbfd6b45dcd913b23a6516694681d3

 so they said the funds will be refunded, and I send them a BTC wallet address to refund my money

and this is what they answered 

https://preview.redd.it/gsqk9vdbmn771.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91141ea6d364809e29b2fa040cc03f2304467ee0

I asked them, when? but I kept getting the same message and they set my request to SOLVED

so after about 2 months I create a follow-up to my previous request and asked them to give me an estimated time but they set my request to solved with no answer

I created few more follow-up requests but the same thing was happening until I tried to do it once more after 2 months, but this time this is what they said :

https://preview.redd.it/nltk9w1ynn771.png?width=1056&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4259f9dc04530b143e198bf3357fd13ed1d85f7b

I was so confused and I was like what does that have to do with my problem I don't know what they were talking about and at the same time I realized my blockchain exchange account is deleted cause when I was trying to sign in it tells me to sign up and an account with this email doesn't exist I tell the new support the whole story again but after about 5 months they still haven't answered me and my request is still open.

after all that and a few months later I create a follow-up to my first request again, first time I explain everything again but all they do was setting my request to SOLVED  with no answer did the same thing again after few months but all I get was a SOLVED request with no message and now its been almost 8 months and still haven't got even an answer.

hope they even hear me out or people in here help me.",1624735400,Sad_Luciferr,True,1,44,2021-06-27

Bitcoin,Is it time to panic?,"

Was Bitcoin an awesome idea from the start? Yes.

Does Bitcoin work? Yes.

Is Bitcoin secure? Yes.

Is Bitcoin scarce? Yes.

Does Bitcoin continue to improve? Yes.

Can a person tell much by looking at price changes over a relatively short period of time? No.

Is Bitcoin's price volatile? Yes.

Does Bitcoin's price volatility matter to long-term, buy-and-hold investors/owners? No.

Do many people know what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works? No.

Do many people understand fiat money? Fractional reserve banking? Central banking? No.

Is the current global financial system still based entirely upon fiat currencies? Yes.

Is fiat money backed by anything? No, not since 1971.

Is fiat money created from thin air by central bankers? Yes, by the trillions.

Is excessive ""money printing"" a form of theft? Yes.

Do fiat currencies always devalue to zero? Yes.

What about today's fiat currencies? They are well on their ways to zero.

Did criminal bankers get bailouts about ten years ago? Yes.

Did criminal bankers go to jail for causing the 2008/9 crisis? No, they got paid huge bonuses from the bailout money.

Did anything significant get fixed as a result of 2008/9. No. In fact, today's situation is even worse than then.

Are banker bailouts still happening? Apparently: recent Fed repo activities... looks like some Too Big To Fail / Too Big To Jail entity is insolvent. Stay tuned.

Is the economy doing well? For the top one-tenth of one percent, yes. For the rest, the bottom 99.9% - with few exceptions, no.

Are there asset bubbles due to central bank activities? Yes, in stocks, bonds, real estate, fine art, etc.

Do asset bubbles always pop? Yes.

Is there negative interest rate debt? Yes. Many trillions, and growing.

In all recorded history, have there ever been negative interest rates? No, not until very recently.

Are negative interest rates a strong warning signal. Yes.

Is Bitcoin better than fiat money? For getting paid and buying groceries, not yet. For long-term, buy-and-hold investing, yes.

Is Bitcoin a better long-term investment than stocks? Yes.

Is Bitcoin better than bonds? Yes.

Is Bitcoin a better long-term investment than real estate? Until the current bubbles pop, certainly. For all time? Yes, because real estate has significant holding costs, real estate can be confiscated, real estate is a sitting duck for high taxes.

Is Bitcoin better than gold? In many ways, yes. Overall, for sure.

Should people panic and sell their Bitcoin holdings because of a sudden change in price? That's not for me to decide. Still, I learned a long time ago not to panic.

Has Bitcoin seen sudden and significant price changes in the past? Yes, both up and down.

What is Bitcoin's long-term ROI? More than 100% per year, on average.

Is there any reason to believe the long-term ROI trend will continue? Read this post again, from the top...",1624723492,Mark_Bear,True,1,94,2021-06-27

Bitcoin,10 things I love about Bitcoin,"The freedom it provides. The hope. How it breeds self-sovereignty. Its mystery and depth. The ever-expanding crew of cyber-hornets. Its indifference to the pundits. Its staunch, principled nature. How it‚Äôs a sledgehammer to corrupt institutions. The rock-solid base layer it sets. 

What could a societal low time-preference look like?

There‚Äôs an evolution occurring as one journeys down the rabbit hole. The search for knowledge transforms us on a foundational level. That‚Äôs a good thing. A creative destruction within. 

What does decentralization entail? A million-headed monster sprouting new body parts every day. How can you stop or even hope to contain that? Who cares about backwards politicians who shoot themselves in the foot? They can suck a fat one. Pray for their citizens though. 

Freedom will follow separation of money and state. Corruption will dissipate. We're taking human lizard-brains out of the equation as we construct a rock-solid foundation for our societies and lives. The network is trustworthy as hell by being trustless. I‚Äôm tired of clinging to bankglomerates that have penetrated our ass lubeless for as long as we can remember. This ship has no captain now. 

Dissolve your ego or you‚Äôll be swarmed by a buzzing band of cyber hornets. I can‚Äôt help but smile as they do their business, stinging and discarding greedheads and imbeciles. Don‚Äôt kick the nest, or else.

I love how it keeps you on your toes. Hornets scour headlines and tweets until their perception is honed. I‚Äôm focused on the mining situation. The ‚Äúgreat migration‚Äù from China dispersing ASICs all over the globe. It‚Äôs about energy. What is the production cost of these digitally native tokens? Can I get in on the action?

One massive central bank sitting in Washington. It stinks of greed and misallocation. Conjuring up trillions with a few keystrokes and handing it to rich fucks who need it the least. At least Blackrock gets to own your entire neighborhood!

Contrast that with the dispersed nature of these humming, juiced-up machines cranking out the currency of the future. Truth-engines devouring cheap energy and producing deflationary bits of encrypted keys we all cherish so deeply.

\---

I love the mindset it demands from me. This is what I call the Zen Hodler Mindset‚Ñ¢. 

Learning to master my emotions as the price manipulates them with roller-coaster gyrations. Reminding myself to zoom out and gaze at the big picture. I find peace the less I check the intra-day price. It‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs better than anxiety. 

I love every individual devoted to the cause, even if I don‚Äôt know them personally. These people have the balls to do critical thinking. They go against what‚Äôs popular, hot and trending. 

Saylor. Pysh. Mallers. Marty. Odell. Gladstein. Parker Lewis. Hordes of others laying the groundwork for a peaceful revolution. 

I love when low time-preference seeps into my psyche. What can we build? With the ability to save money, we can think in decade-long increments. Building a skill/craft slowly and methodically is possible when the ground underneath us isn‚Äôt crumbling. 

What else? At its core it is hope. A brighter tomorrow. Sprawling citadels where life is but a dream. What have we been working toward if not a better world? I craft that vision over time, as the journey unfolds and motivation Strikes like Lightning Labs.

Only the righteous will survive. Greedlove got popped and was a corpse faster than JFK. Trust no one but yourself. That‚Äôs a tenet of this peer-to-peer wasteland.

https://postimg.cc/gallery/y3X8w7j


Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your fears! 

I thought I should take a moment and clear things up. I've gotten a lot of messages of support but many more with questions. Please read everything here and I hope this answers some questions. 


For those of you that I haven't ran into over the years, my name is Withers. I was a friend and enemy of John. I first met him when I was around 14. John was very different then. Still eccentric and crazy but very different. He changed around 2007 and never fully came back. What most have seen in the last 15 years is an old man that was addicted to many drugs, paranoid, losing money hand over fist and scamming just to live and get his fix. He wasn't always this way. 


However, before I move on, it's important that I'm honest with you. John, for at minimum the last ten years, has been a very evil man. He has hurt a lot of people. Between his paranoia, his drug induced rage and sexual desires, and his scams, he hurt a lot of people and there families. 


In fall of 2018 a friend showed me some documents, where John had been accused of rape in TN. It happened after Guatemala. She was a 15 year old girl at a party. Apparently she was thought to be an of age prostitute. Long story short, there was minimal evidence and with help, it was closed and kept quiet. 


I spent the fall and spring, talking to his friends, enemies and so on. I believe Allison. I only confronted john once with evidence of these sexual charges. He was guilty but he hated it. Never stated it.  He would go through good times and bad times. Using drugs to get through the bad, which made him crazy and more paranoid. 


To Allison and anyone else he hurt, know that when I knew for sure, I did what I could. I am so sorry that he hurt you!  He was like a crazy uncle in some ways and dealing with it was incredibly difficult. He did have a lot of friends and knew just enough to have a few favors stored away. 


To anyone he scammed, I apologize on behalf of the old, eccentric but sane John Mcafee. He was always very savvy but late in life he turned to outright scamming. I and others he trusted can not pay back hundreds of thousands or fix the emotional and mental damage he did. I do hope you get help and continue to search for happiness. I wish it was black and white but it's not, it's very complicated. I did manage to keep the mcafeemagic bs down, the best I could. 


John Mcafee is dead. I promise you. He waited on someone to make a call or send the right people, and no one did. He waited for months. You see John had some secrets. Old secrets. His entire life started with a secret. He killed his father when he was 16. You could tell when he told the real story. He would cry non stop. 


His dad was a drunk. He would beat John and his mother. John shot him. With a shotgun when he was drunk and abusive. You'll find little about his mother. She's a complicated woman. More complicated than his dad. He was very troubled early on. 


John fell into shit at Booz Hamilton and kept finding his way up. Got his secrets in the 80s-early 90s. Secrets are like fresh baked bread. They start losing their value the moment you take them out of the oven. 


I wrestled. For a long time. Through many accounts I lurked and asked. Finally on Monday I asked one last time. Hoping someone would jump to his defense. But I knew what he had become. 


https://np.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/o6fwbq/is_john_mcafee_worth_saving/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf



I posted that question the moment I heard about his extradition. I'm sure someone can confirm the time I posted it. There were people there watching and waiting. I know the protocol. I know what comes next. I had the chance to make a call. Try. But I didn't. John was always complicated. He was in many ways a genius. But he had done a lot of horrible things. I've talked to many of his associates and friends. Between the drugs and scars, he just lost it. Whatever it is. I am sorry I didn't make the call. But not sorry enough to change the decision if I could. 


I am guilty of helping John. Many many years ago.  Then guilty of destroying John. Once I knew what he had done, the options were limited. He knew enough to weasel out of things. So I kept him busy. Kept him moving and broke. I know he was broke. A broke and running scared Mcafee is the best I could do. I'm sorry I couldn't do more to those he hurt. It is complicated. I kept him on the damn boat floating between ports, burning his and Brocks digital cash. Sadly, some of that he scammed was from some of you guys. Now I think that by keeping him running maybe he stole more from people. But I saw everything he did while he was running. And he didn't hurt anyone. I made sure. That was my goal. He kept getting off but I knew what he was. So I kept my running. Until I couldn't handle him. So..... I left him to the system. 


Looking back maybe my keeping him running was my inability to handle the truth. I don't know. I mean I didn't have any more evidence  than any other prosecutor. I didn't have a smoking gun. John did stupid, horrible  things when he was drugged or drunk. But he knew to tidy them up. If I had something that was 100 percent, I would have turned it in, but it's hard to get things to stick to John. Not to mention, certain people have passed since then, which now makes this much easier. 


I messaged a lot of you, from old post in those hours of contemplation. Thank you for sharing with me. The good and mostly bad. 

Janice....... Well see the texts posted 

John, the cyber security legend is no more. Actually, he never was. John's brilliance was never cyber. It is so hard to befriend a person that does such horrible things. He is gone and a weight is lifted. He can now, no longer hurt anyone. He was a very innovative man, but it was not worth it the pain he caused. 


I hope John's legacy is of a troubled man. A man with demons. Brilliant and evil. A believer in freedom. However, he had the luxury of having that freedom with those secrets protecting his ass. I think his life would of been very different if he never found out certain things. He did some good things though. I hope one day everyone knows the whole story. 


I know some will say I didn't do enough, soon enough. You maybe right, but I did what I could and ultimately, the day he was extradited was one of the hardest of my life. I made the decision not to save him and he's gone now. Just like that. No time for regrets. People shouldn't hurry other people!  No matter what they know! 

Even though you were crazy and I'll, part of me will miss you John. 

Remember Julian!

Bitcoin,China VS Bitcoin 2021,"China is trying to take over the dollar at a low currency. The yuan is lower than the dollar at the level that China has planned. It will benefit China in terms of exports. and production of export products But the dollar fell beyond the threshold. or risk that China will be able to balance it (Actually, there are many factors), one of the main ones comes from the crypto market, so China only needs a balance of the currency. and other assets held by China including public debt in dollars only (Don't let which one is too high or too low), but since the beginning of 2021, China has started to worry that Crypto, especially Bitcoin, is taking away control of China's financial game. Watch the Dollar Fall as Bitcoin &amp; Cryptos Rebound Significantly And because the money game's insidiousness lies in its control. not destructive Therefore, China must come up with a new strategy. by creating a situation and the news that floods in until new investors have to shake as well as the trick that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates (Despite the fact that QE money is pumped out in abundance) because this is China's plan to begin to adjust the market price for the dump. Something that they own. What can you do???
The fact that the US came out to raise interest rates and pushed QE back into the market meant a signal. The bubble in the dollar that was born until it was clearly visible. Because when investors fear the bubble may burst soon Everyone will rush back to the safest things (for investors) are US assets and gold. In fact, at this point in time, the vast majority of holdings are China. This kind of money game is much more brutal than destroying Bitcoin. It has to do whatever it takes to lure inexperienced investors to flee US Asset and Gold before dumping them on the market. So the only thing that still remains is The world's bitcoin and crypto frenzy will make this China's plan. It's more difficult to accomplish because investors have a very high chance of turning to bitcoin and other cryptos instead. I hope you read this line. I wish you all good luck and please study the risks before investing every time.

So basically if China is shutting down Btc in favor of its own digital currency, and with the 100th Anniversary of the CCP coming soon, meaning the crackdown can only get more ferocious, I'm trying to wrap my head around the world consequences in the near and long future.

- Whats gonna happen to the people who own btc in China if they can't sell? Are they going to hold indefinitely? How is that going to affect price?
- How is the price affected since mining operations shut down? Doesn't that mean the availability of btc is going to be constricted, making it more valuable? Or would it be good news if some other country starts mining like crazy?
-Can't say China is going to keep out of btc forever, I'm almost sure the party is still going to use that btc in some way for political deals etc, just like how they hold usd. Maybe theyre gonna take away the btc of its citizens?

I have a majority in webull and Robinhood.
Both in red due to last 2 months.  Which I was fine with since I was holding long term anyways.

But frankly my plan was just till wait till it was green and start slowly selling so I can rebuy on the exchange and have in my wallet.   If btc is worth 80K.  Doesn't matter to me if have to ""rebuy"" over at coinbase at that rate. Since I'll just be transfer funds locations.


The hard part is with the current price point I would hate to sell. And then have it go up on me while I bring the cash over to rebuy in.   

Has anyone else faced this issue?   What's a good approach to reduce that lapse time.

The money I have to invest I have been putting into btc on coinbase pro.   But most of the money I have invested is on the other platforms... Which technically you don't own any actual crypto.

I guess my plan right now be to continue to invest in what I can over on coinbase. And then eventually when my Robin Hood is back in the green just sell it incrementally and move funds to coinbase/ hard wallet over time?",1624715426,Complete_Composer_93,True,1,44,2021-06-26
Bitcoin,El Salvador: Don't FUD and take stupid conclusions,"I just saw there is a ton of negative comments and FUD around the recent video of the president of Salvador talking about bitcoin. 

Please, first think, educate and then talk.

**1. He said instant transactions and no fees** 

Yes, he said that. He talks about the wallet (Chivo) they are ruling out at September. If you use their app (as salvatorian) you will get 0 fees and 0 waiting time.

**2. But it's not decentralized **

You are not forced to use their app, it's optional.

The benefits of using their app as Salvatorian:

* 30 usd in btc free
* instant exchange between usd and btc
* no transaction fees
* instant transaction 

Cons

* need to kyc
* centralized

Obviously they need to kyc people that want to exchange btc to usd throught their app. Nobody wants a drug dealer or a child abuser to change money in their app.

You can freely use any wallet you prefer, nor mandatory to use their app. Take it as a bank. They offer their bank (Chivo) with lot of benefits and some cons, but you can also have your preferred bank (coinbase...) or have your btc in your pocket (hardware wallet, cold wallet...).


El Salvador is doing a great thing for Bitcoin. Obviously isn't a perfect way, but they can't (and don't want) just educate and promote the masses to use their own hardware wallet or cold wallet, or decentralized, because of:

* too complicated 
* they would aim people to go out of their radar 

If you build a business, you want to somehow have a control of your employers (so they can't steal your money), the same applies to the countries.

¬†¬†¬† ‚Ä¢ You can check out my new post on bitcointalk.org¬† - the whole issue is described there more detailed :¬† 
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5345262.msg57291953#msg57291953



Now, I don't quite remember how &amp; what happend but here is the thing: 

¬†1. I've created an Electrum wallet on Windows &amp; Tails OS (will refer to it as E_Wind &amp; E_Tails)¬† 

2. Did a test transaction of BTC 0.000112 from E_Wind onto E_Tails - I could see the transaction straight away in Tails wallet. Was remarkably for a quite a long time displayed as ""unconfirmed"" &amp; later on as ""not verified"" though, but I could see it at least in the wallet.¬†¬† ¬†transaction ID:¬†https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/888f769c2d2585d1d6f0070f11d5820c249aa895fab983ce3eda7e1a667e7308¬†¬† ¬†(1st address in the screenshot) 

3. Then I did the bigger transaction &amp; that transaction I couldn't see ever since. 

¬†4. Turned out that the E_Tails was outdated but I was unaware of that, &amp; so I tried different options to do something about, like followed the guide lines on tails website:¬†¬† ¬†to delete the wallet and recover it again 

5. So I did it. Deleted &amp; recovered again - didn't work. 

6. I couldn't see the transaction because I couldn't connect to the servers because it was outdated.¬†Which means I created E_Tails offline 

7. Then I understood that E_Tails is outdated on Tails OS and so I updated it to V. 3.3.8And here is where the SH!T starts boiling



8. Since I've created it offline on outdated version &amp; followingly deleted, as suggested in the guide lines - now that wallet was ""gone""! 

¬†9. As the E_Tails was now up-to-date, I wanted to recover that wallet¬†¬† ¬† Typed in the same mnemonic phrase, as before (when I tried to fix it myself without the guide lines) &amp; now all of a sudden I get a¬†¬† ¬† different wallet with different addresses. 

10. Ever since I type in the seed I always get this ""newer"" wallet and never the 1st one with the funds!



Here is what I assume: 

¬†¬†¬† The seed has generated in first place a wallet with a different derivation path. The seed has¬†generated the wallet while I was offline in Electrum manager - seems like that it was generated as a cold wallet/hardware wallet. 

Here is why I assume:
¬†¬†¬† As I type in the same seed in Elcertum wallet &amp; check the BIP39 box &amp; following type the derivation path m/44'/0'/0', I get different addresses that I have used, after I updated the E_Tails (I see transactions on this addresses), opposed to if I just type in the seed without derivation path (there I see only 1 transaction on 1 address). 

Here is the catch:
¬†¬†¬† If I check the BIP39 box and type in any derivation path (I tried planty of them) then Elcetrum¬†¬† ¬†tells me ""checksum failed"" &amp; once I go ahead and am already in the wallet: go wallet &gt; seed¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†I can't display the seed.¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Where as if I just type in the seed without derivation path, I am able displaying the seed.



The point is - I need the correct derivation path - at least it is what I assume.
¬†¬†¬† Q: How to get the correct derivation path for the 2 addresses where the funds are at? 

I tried iancoleman.io, the modified tool for Electrum wallet. (not the original iancoleman.io) 
¬†¬†¬† I'm able of getting out the initial wallet with its addresses¬†¬† -¬†¬† but I need the one with different derivation path¬†¬† -¬† and this I am not able to find in that tool 

There was another good website bitcoinfunction.com Somehow is not around anymore.
¬†¬†¬† Q: Does anyone know websites alike?
¬†¬†¬† Q: Could seedrecovery.py work, does it recover derivation paths? - It helps recovering the seed, but I know my seed, I don't need to recover it, right.


I have the right seed, I just need right derivation path or the right account 


To make something clear:¬†the seed is absoulute correct¬†beacause I've used the same one to recover the ""lost"" wallet ----before I did the update---- and I did recover! 

Here you can see the screenshot with the addresses of the ""lost""wallet.
https://anonfiles.com/vdA86d26u4/ElectrumWallet_Tails_BTC_addresses_jpg 

That is the address I need to recover &amp; where the funds are at: 1LP6LQ726YJR9wkPLnHWJEfH335DDuiNtL (in screenshot second from the top) 

Shall my assumption be incorrect, you're very welcome telling me what you think but be reasonable - stuff like wrong seed &amp; etc. is out of question!

# First, a couple of caviats;

\- I am not a Bitcoin OG. I didn't know about it in 2013. I hated it in 2017. I FOMOed in 2018. I was surprised in 2020. And I love and understand it in 2021.

\- I am not a financial advisor, and I am speaking on behalf of the company I own which employs just south of 20 people.

\- We don't have a massive treasury and are inexperienced as a company investing in assets and other instruments

\- English is not my mother tongue, so bear with me.

\- Fuck you Elon.

&amp;#x200B;

In this piece I'll do my best and explain from a small corporate perspective why accumulating Bitcoin became part of the corporate strategy and unanimously accepted by the general assembly.

# First, some background to who we are as a company

I founded the marketing agency back in 2017 and we quickly hired alot of people and attracted great clients. Our work is a combination of video production, copywriting, graphic design, web, podcast and everything social media. Basically, we are a marketing department that our clients ""subscribe"" to for 12 months with certain limitations for a fixed price. Our projected revenue 2021 EOY is about 2,5M USD.

We are known for being provacative, experimental and the ""go-to-place"" for small B2B companies to jumpstart their marketing game.

Again, our business model is not very scalable. It's human trafficking (it's a joke!!!) - we need one guy or gal to do some work, and that work can only be done so many times in a day. If we want to do more of that work, we need to hire a new guy or gal and so on. And if you don't have BCG or McKinsey in your logo - the ability to scale on premium price is very difficult as well. The avarage profit margin in Norway in our industry is about 3-4%. Eeeew. The ""only"" way to make big buck with this kind of business model is either scale massively on people, price or both. The cost that makes up about 85% of the total, is rent for office space and labour cost, so it requires alot to make that happen. It's very risky to scale an agency business with people if you don't have alot of cash on hand - which we don't have.

We've been in business like I said since 2017 and so far we have not made a meaningful profit yet. We have OK salaries, but that's it. We are smart, creative and driven people - so the salary, even though it is OK, it is not extremely good. And we do want to create a company that can pay out significant dividends to make up for the struggle of building, running and owning a company. With current model, that seems to be a stretch medium-term.

# The Pandemic Gave Perspective On Things

Like most other places, within a week from March 9th to March 12th of 2020, the semantics went from ""yeye, I don't care"", to; ""OMFG"". It literally turned most of our business upside down and was a really chaotic experience. The unthinkable paradox happened; everyone wanted to sell something, but none wanted to buy anything. Except fucking toilet paper.

Marketing, and especially external marketing consultants, is not business critical to everyone, maybe even anyone, during a world crisis. And obviously we faced a lot of pushback from our clients. So we are grateful that most stayed with us, but some left. Leaving our business extremely volnurable as we don't have the liquidity to simply shut down.

A few months in during the pandemic, my partner told me: ""Dude, Bitcoin just hit 30k"". We had been speculating somewhat back in 2017 and found crypto to be somewhat interesting, but at the same time a piece of shit idea. And I remember thinking to myself that we were going to see another meltdown like never before with crypto. But, then I started reading about it. I read about Michael Saylor, Tesla's purchase, banks recruiting experts, ETF's trying to be accepted, Queen Cathie Woods, white papers, Cointelegraph, Bitcoin Magazine and so on. Not only that, but our very own Kjell Inge R√∏kke (one of Norway's wealthiest) just put 60 million dollars in it and started a crypto company. 

I am not the smartest guy in the crypto room, but these guys are - and now I was on my journey of juggling a struggling company during the pandemic, firing bad people and also putting in the first 1000 hours of understanding Bitcoin, the money system and how this will be adopted as a revolutionary technology 5-10 years from now. 

And then I realized...

# Why Bitcoin Is Not A Risky Bet (for us)

I've done several bad hires - actually a couple to many because of my own naivity. During the worst period of corona last year we knew that we had 4 bad hires in our organization. That is pretty significant as we were only 15 employees at the time.

This might be a controversial line, but hiring **bad** people is a zero-sum game in which the employee is the winner and the employer is the loser. A bad hire is the true Rat Poison Squared as the faggot would say.

Now, most of you I assume live in the US and I live in Norway. Two completely different hiring/firing laws. In Norway, you simply can't fire someone ""just because"". Making the bad hire outcome even worse, since the process of firing someone that don't create any value for the company is a tedious process - time consuming, energy draining, lawyer fees and always a ""settlement package"" including minimum 3 months of salary. I know of entrepreneur peers that simply went bankrupt because of a few bad hires early on that just dragged the process so long that the company didn't have any liquidity left. And yes, I agree that the employer has a responsibility of not making those mistakes. But, come on bro. 

The point I'm trying to make here is that if you have made a bad hire; it is like watching your stock go from whatever price to 0. It literally is a 100% loss. And the chances of getting even the slightest amount of value from a bad hire is also near 0%. Bad hire bad. Good hire good. 

So I thought to myself at first in winter 2021. What if we trim our agency to become a truly premium business, work on upskilling people, and invest in what we already have and add a few seniors to our team, and then re-invest the hypotethically cost of bad hires in Bitcoin? Either we double in size and go from about 20 people to 40 and making 5M revenue with 10% margin and along the way waste a shit ton of money on bad hires. Because, trust me, bad hires comes with volume in recruiting. There is no way past it. 

Or we invest and accumulate Bitcoin and dream about a 10x return within the next 4-5 years with alot less company risk, governance, stress and hazzle. I liked the latter idea so much that I wanted to pursue it as a core strategy for our company and change my role from being just a ""CEO"" to Master of Coin. A fun ego boost as well. 

I needed to convince the group of equity partners and also the small board we have. And I'd like to share with you guys how I did it.

My understanding of it is that, if the L1 network was a WAN, the LN would be a MAN, allowing everyone in it to interact with each other and sometimes interacting with the exterior.

But doesn't that mean that we know that the accounts in the LN are in a certain country for example? If every Salvadoran gets a wallet on the LN, on the Salvadoran LN, then can't we assume that these wallets are all managed by Salvadoran? Isn't it  facilitating the identification process?

if you think to put any money on any coin consider:  
\- checking the team behind it  
\- road map  
\- what have they done so far  
\- have the code have been audited  
\- what is their value proposition  
\- Tokenomics and potential  
\- any coin with token supply over the billions must be avoidable at all cost.

Bitcoin,Nicehash Profits/Swing Trading/Exchanges,"I apologize in advance If I sound like a total noob to this, but i feel like reddit is the best way to get an accurate  answer on this. So I started using Nicehash about 2 months ago to make some passive income by earning BTC.  Everything's going great I have low electric costs, using my PC that's mainly used for gaming to run most of the day on Nicehash. I might be getting a little greedy, but i'm trying to see if its possible to make an attempt  to make more BTC off the profits I'm making.

Ive been watching Bitcoin since I started and it seems  like ever since its dropped from the 50-60k range its been bouncing back and forth between the low 30s to the higher 30s. My thought process is  to let it climb to around the 40k mark, sell, then buy back in when it dips down again. (considering this trend continues) Obviously its a gamble, but other then the few extra bucks im spending on electric and the extra wear and tear on my PC components , I feel like its a risk I'm willing to take.  Even if The price shoots way up after I rebuy , or shoots way down after I sell.

Couple of questions  I  would have about this would be would it really be worth it? After taxes and fees( Withdrawing profits straight to coinbase since I don't pay anything to do it, but about a 2$ fee if I want to sell or buy) Say Im only starting with about a 20 -30 dollar profit If I wait for it to go up about 5k within a couple of weeks or so, and hoping for a snowball effect as time goes on.

 Should I sell it for Fiat money?or would it make any more sense to convert to a stable coin, possibly earning interest while I wait for a better selling point? 

Using coinbase is convenient right now since I can withdraw straight from nicehash for free, but would it make more sense to withdraw or trade from somewhere else to avoid the higher coinbase fees?",1624691480,MrBlueKrabs,True,1,6,2021-06-26

Bitcoin,Does r/Buttcoin constitute a hate group?,"My post is about two aspects of the subreddit r/Buttcoin in relation to Bitcoin.

1) I have visited the forum a few times, typically by accident as it shows up on my feed and I don't notice that it's not r/Bitcoin before I've read some of the comments. Originally I felt it was a ridiculous place, a place primarily for insult trading, but generally harmless. But lately I've seen their rhetoric has grown more aggressive, they've taken to placing flairs on Bitcoin supporters, essentially labeling them derogatorily, which has eerie parallels with general authoritarian behaviour towards certain groups, and I see the subreddit as being increasingly hateful towards the people who are supporting Bitcoin as opposed to being against the technology itself. If it is a hate group, am I off base in questioning why such a subreddit is acceptable on Reddit?

2) More of an inference and warning to fellow investors and supports of Bitcoin, that some of the rhetoric I'm seeing online in places like r/Buttcoin and even overhearing in the public, are extremely aggressive against us, and it would be wise of us all to realise that there is a distrust, fear and hatred out there towards those our industry, and that it may grow exponentially as the impact of Bitcoin grows exponentially. I am issuing a warning to everyone here, to be less casually vocal about your involvement in Bitcoin. Yes, it is fine engage in Expo's and speak with like-minded people and share strategies and so on, but in general I think it's more important than ever to keep our cards closer to our chests in everyday life or risk the possibility of future negative consequences ranging from losing jobs, to losing access to services, political retribution, and even to aggression or in the most extreme events, lynch mobs.

People who spent 20 to 50 dollars at the grocery store in their childhood are spending hundreds today, in another ten to 20 years they could easily be spending thousands.

The US pays off its national debt with the money they receive from new bond market investors, creating even more national debt in the process. This is exactly how a Ponzi scheme works with how they take new investor money to pay off old investors. Eventually, the bubble grows too big to ever be paid off by any new wave of investors, forcing them to print more money and further dilute the dollar just to pay it off its own debts once there are not enough new investors to pay off the old national debts.

IDK about you, but I rather have some of my savings in a finite mathematical equation than trust the dollar's 'new investor funds paying off older investors' system that literally functions like a Ponzi scheme.",1624669649,SatOnMyBalls_,True,1,2,2021-06-26

Prolly it's apparent that there's a huge 1000% increase in short position on Bitfinex for BTC.

Thrs a high likelihood that this is a calibrated move by China miners to:
a) Short first
b) Coordinate dump later

If so, the ethos of shorting out a known and targeted entity (e.g. hedge funds) through short squeezing (i.e. GME, AMC) can be a viable play here.

Bitcoin,FUD in El Salvador has me a bit worried. #NadieQuiereBitcoin (ie #NobodyWantsBitcoin) is trending in Twitter there. Time to get some Popcorn.,"Just so tired of how mainstream is twisting everything.

Being a native Spanish speaker I've been following local media. The FUD against Bitcoin is really strong.

Bukele is widelly being made fun of for saying ""Every business has to accept Bitcoin but doesn't have to receive it"" This is obviously correct, as merchants have the choice to instantly get their payment converted to dollar, but taken out of context is a great line for haters and propaganda makers.

The 30$ dollar airdrop is being criticized because you need to use the government app to get it (Which has id + facial recognition KYC)... ""what will they do with our data?"" Even if is completely optional and you can use any LN app you like. At the same time they criticize Bitcoin because it will suit criminals and money laundry... I just don't get it.

I am really intrigued how this will play out. Only 90 days of implementation and education are really optimistic and I can understand the fear of those in El Salvador who have no idea how BTC works and what it is. I really wish this does not backfire on BTC.

Bitcoin,Some of you need to read this.,"There is currently a BIG effort by governments (specially China and the USA) to try to kill or severly hamper BTC and other forms of Crypto.

Taking the money printing power away from them in currency and a store of value that is decentralized, unhackable, fast, reliable and universally accepted spells really bad news for them.

The current price drops are prodcuts of this (there are already many posts detailingf the massive shorts). We will see MANY more attacks in th efuture and a whole lot of FUD. (my ""classic"" financial news sources and analyses have been full of it the last week when they would't even acknowledge it's existence before).

If you put more money into it that you require for your daily life for the next 6 months or more, it's gonna be pretty rough. Reconsider just putting in what you want to save for HODLing for 2+ years.

Remember 1 BTC =1 BTC. If you believe BTC will hold it's value in the long run, then just forget about it. In 5 years you can check back and find you can afford a whole lot.

The news always focuses on the negative aspects for BTC but governments (specially CHina) has never liked Bitcoin.

The reality is:

* BTC is now legal tender in some countries with more to come.
* Financial institutions have invested in BTC.
* There is a much wider awareness of the ""common folk"" of what BTC is and they want to get into it but fear they are ""too late"" (spoiler, they're not).
* Companies are starting to buy BTC and other Crypto (mainly ETH) to hold as an investment and crucially as a store of cvalue to hedge against hgeavy rising inflation.
* INflation in the world is going to unseen levels in many couuntries due to so much printing and the effect of the USD on other currencies will create a domino printing effect. They can and will continue to print a LOT of money while BTC is only a finite amount hich is known to all.
* We are still at least 2 and a half years away from the next halving (which will increase the value even more).
* China banning mining is great news for everyone but the chinese miners.
* No one person or group has control of BTC supply (no one can create more).
* It has broken it's biggest obstacle: People have given faith and value to BTC in spite of it being ""just code"" and not a physical token created by a bank. The acceptance of BTC will not recede, it will only gain in time.

My point is: If you understand and think about it rationally, BTC has surpassed all the previous attempts and the facts are there of it's continued growth, acceptance and use. The previos gains in the year were proof of it and it will skyrocket once the conditions are set for it. If you can HODL for what you have, you will have done your future self an incredible favor, but don't invest what you need or will need in your daily life as that creates a lot of anxiety which makes people check like crazy and suffer a dip to 35,000 without realizing the valu it had just a year prior.",1624656660,alclab,True,1,13,2021-06-26

Bitcoin,"Don't Like Job, All I Think About is Buying Bitcoin","Hello Everyone,

So, I'm new to this thread, but the title pretty much says it all. I don't like my job (or the rat race in general), and the only thing I think about while I'm on the clock is the fact that I get to buy Bitcoin every 2 weeks. I'm sharing this with you guys because not that many people in my life know how excited I am about Bitcoin, and I just needed to get it off my chest. Comment/ask whatever you'd like, I just want to know if other people feel this way, and maybe get some support from those who might have been going through this longer than I have.

Thanks for listening.",1624652629,sehr16,True,1,33,2021-06-26

Given bitcoin's supply inflation and the $2 trillion market cap mark, I could see the 100k mark taking another 3-4 years. For bitcoin to even reach 100k at the end, there has to be a large buy-in from wealthy retail investors and institutional support. Right now we are lacking significant institutional support and even though banks like Citibank have opened up crypto assets, it's still a long way off.

Nowadays, with the increasingly serious global warming, it has become a huge problem in the process of¬†human beings development. Therefore, ""environmental protection"" has currently become key point and direction of the transfer of higher industries globally. Undoubtedly, it must be acknowledged the significance¬†of cars to human beings. In the context of rapid technological progress, major global automobile manufacturers, led by Tesla, have successively launched new energy vehicles such as pure electric models and hybrid electric models. Volkswagen even announced that it would take some measures to stop developing traditional internal combustion engines. New energy vehicles soon as it comes to achieve the global consumers favor, but at the same time the widely use of new energy vehicles still exist many problems as follows:¬†such as the low coverage rate of charging piles, the fear of running long distances, the fear of long-term congestion, the shrinking battery life in winter still plague global consumers, and also discourage many users who are willing to consider purchasing new energy vehicles.

However, the birth of New energy vehicle blockchain will eventually change all this. There is no doubt that blockchain will be the most reliable,¬†widely used and most convenient development model for mankind in the future. Therefore, we boldly integrate blockchain technology and concepts into practical services to solve the biggest problem for the smooth development of new energy vehicles. At the same time, we have provided¬†an unprecedented mining environment and low threshold for partners who are willing to¬†generate income by mining. You can freely choose to be the holder of NEVB or one of our NEVB mine owners.

NEVB is a highly autonomous token issued based on mainnet of ETH, which was written into BSSG remote intelligent machine docking system for the first time, and completely realized remote multi-point decentralized intelligent management of physical mining machines (intelligent charging piles in new energy vehicle blocks). It is worth mentioning that the self-developed SZPW mining coin integrated intelligent algorithm is used for the first time, that is to say, the charging amount of users of mining machines (intelligent charging piles in new energy automobile blocks) is equally converted into computing power, and 15% of the charging pile income is equally distributed to each mine owner.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img gbp2hovpsf771...*

The total number of NEVB issued is 300 million 

Among them,

30%: Permanent fixed storage to ensure all possible expenses for the construction of physical mining machines after ICO is issued

30%: Used for token ICO listing and mine pool circulation

15%: Used for initial public private placement (Note: The official website is the only subscription address)

5%:Used for incentive recognized period subscription partners

5%: Used for exchange and mine pool award

10%: Used for reward the team partners

5%: Used for reward early miners

The NEVB mining machine is upgraded and transformed on the basis of charging piles for new energy vehicles. besides the basic components of traditional charging piles, each mining machine is also loaded with the KingPd intelligent block system independently developed, which successfully realizes a new mining machine that is remote, shared, transparent and irreplaceable, namely as long as someone uses NEVB charging piles to charge, each mining owner who invests in mining machines will gain profits from this transaction. Besides, KingPd system will be converted into NEVB or ETH according to the currency exchange rate of each country and the market value of each virtual currency.

The NEVB mining method is significantly different from the previous virtual currency mining method. Specifically, the previous mining machines mostly use computer groups for mining. Due to its excessive energy consumption and a series of other legal problems, it has been suppressed to varying degrees by the local governments of some countries and regions, thus increasing the risk of investment in mining machines. NEVB is the mining income through the physical charging station, which will also bring improvement and upgrade to the local environment, so there is no need to worry about being suppressed and cleared, NEVB mining mechanism will also fully protect the property and income of the mine owners.

In order to completely decentralized private irregularities and avoid some community fraud groups activities, we adopt the method of official public private early subscribe for the first time, before NEVB market circulation, our official website is the only access to the address, we will adopt intelligent control of a computer system to complete the deal with you, Our Public Private Placement Plan will be announced on our official Twitter account. Please follow our official website and official Twitter account for all public private placement matters.

Looking back over the past decades years, blockchain has been accompanied with us for 12 years, perhaps you have no idea from which day you start to be fascinated by blockchain, maybe it brings you countless glory and wealth, or makes you suffer trough and loses, Looking back at the past, there will always be too many regrets and nostalgia. Perhaps we shall recall whether we are still standing in the same place. we want to witness the future with you together! NEVBÔºÅGO!

Bitcoin,Great China Hashrate Migration: we might see a maximum difficulty drop of -25%. Here's what it means for miners.,"This year‚Äôs great China Hashrate Migration has turned into a Hashrate Exodus. Much has been said about long-term implications for decentralization and the mining industry as a whole. Let's zoom in on the next difficulty epoch: an **unprecedented period of mining profitability**.

![img](tdpkyf1yhf771 ""insights.braiins.com"")

At the moment, difficulty is expected to adjust down 20% in 1 week. Based on more recent block times, we may even see a **maximum downward adjustment of 25%**.

![img](en7lpnv3if771)

![img](29lq4dq4if771 ""Explanation of why difficulty adjustments are capped, from Mastering Bitcoin."")

This means that **mining profitability will increase by 20-25% in BTC terms** ‚Äî **the largest increase in Bitcoin‚Äôs history**. While hundreds of thousands of ASICs sit idle in trucks, cargo ships, planes, and warehouses, those that remain online become more valuable.

Let‚Äôs check some profitability stats, starting with the machine that redefined ASIC longevity: the **Antminer S9.** Using Braiins OS+ firmware with overclocking settings to maximize revenue, we see an increase of 2700 sats/day &amp; nearly $1/day profit with 3¬¢/kWh electricity.

![img](dsh5h5zaif771 ""insights.braiins.com"")

![img](69fepapcif771)

How about the latest-gen? Here‚Äôs a look at the **Antminer S19 Pro**. Pre-adjustment, it‚Äôs already mining nearly 70k sats/day. After a conservative -20% adjustment, revenue increases to 86.7k sats/day and profit jumps by almost $6/day with 6¬¢/kWh electricity.

Even with stock firmware, the **Whatsminer M20S** is profiting nearly $10/day at 6¬¢/kWh electricity.   Factor in the -20% adjustment, and you gain 11k sats/day, or an extra tree fiddy ($3.50) in fiat profit.

 And if you are a miner we know, we know: wen whatsminer Braiins OS+???

![img](y3xwiywqif771)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When making mining profitability projections, it‚Äôs always wise to factor in a steep difficulty adjustment. The **average adjustment since 2017 has been more than +5%, meaning that mining profitability has typically decreased by 5% every 2 weeks.**

For miners outside of China who prepared for the typical difficulty increases, these downward adjustments mean that they‚Äôll outperform even their most optimistic projections for Q2 and Q3 2021.

**End.** Salute to all the miners in China who have helped secure the Bitcoin network for the past decade. It's the end of an era.

BTC is steadily decreasing in price - not saying that only because of that, but it sure helps driving the price down by creating a huge sell pressure. I am not big fan of conspiracy theories and WSB blame-the-short-sellers game, but it sure looks suspicious. If you look at that shorts charts on bitfinex, they always seem to rise immensely in a single day. I suggest looking at BTC shorts for any BTC holder that wants to buy/sell. If anyone has good theories on why these shorts behave this way - let's discuss it, as I would be very interested.

Bitcoin,I put my savings into Bitcoin,"After a lot thinking, reading, and researching, last week I completed putting my savings into Bitcoin. I did it over a span multiple weeks (following the dollar-cost averaging strategy). I haven't told people that they know me about this, and not planning to (for security reasons). Here is my thinking about why I did it and things that I considered:

* I'm debt free and have no responsibilities (not married, no kids, etc.), so for me the time is right.
* I came across crypto first back in 2017, I was interested in the technical side more than the finical side. Bought a little back then, never sold it. Seen it dropped more than 50% in the short term and gained more than 200% in the long term. In the long term, it increases.
* I'm in it for the long term (minimum: 10 years, maximum: forever).
* There will be never more than 21 million Bitcoin. That's scarcity, scarcity has value.
* Bitcoin adoption is increasing rapidly.
* Everything in life has a risk factor, for me holding a fiat currency in a bank that is losing value and purchasing power due to inflation is riskier than buying Bitcoin.
* I did my homework about crypto and security back in 2017 (private keys, cold storage, etc.), so jumping in is technically easy.
* I kept 1 year worth of expenses in fiat.
* I have a full time job so even if the price goes to zero I can start over.
* I'm a skilled software engineer so even if I lose my job I can find another one or do freelancing.

After all, maybe I will be wrong, and yes, maybe I will lose it all, but I'm willing to take my chances. The important thing for me is that I feel good about my decision.

**Disclaimer:** this is not a finial advice by any mean, I'm just sharing my experience. Everyone's life and circumstances are different, and never put what you cannot afford to lose.",1624633787,LonelyInTheNewLand,True,1,112,2021-06-25

Bitcoin,"IF you want Bitcoin's price to stay flat, like the price of gold...","...then you should root for the ETFs, bring on the ""custodial"" bullshit, and store YOUR Bitcoins on some exchange. Bring on the rehypothecation. Bring on the Wall St. criminals who will sell hundreds of times more Bitcoin than actually exist.  

Just make sure you tell people, ""it's good for adoption"" while you play the stooge for Wall St. criminals. Be sure to explain how your parents are too stupid to use a Bitcoin wallet, so we'll know that you inherited it from them.  

**ETFs open the door to bad things**.

**Rehypothecation**: Look at the price of gold; it has been artificially suppressed via ""paper gold"". Search, ""physical gold vs paper gold"". ETFs open the door for evil people to suppress the price of Bitcoin by selling Bitcoins that don't exist, or, if you prefer, selling the same Bitcoin to many clients (dozens, hundreds), all at the same time. Don't be quick yell ""hooray for Bitcoin ETFs.""

**Government confiscation**: As the US dollar collapses (along with every other fiat currency), it will reach a point where they decide they ""need"" some money with value, to pay the military, for example. They'll decide they ""need"" to confiscate Bitcoins (and probably gold, too). The only Bitcoins they'll be able to confiscate will be those in held in custody, such as ETFs, exchanges, GBTC, etc. When this happens, those who have been beating the ""Not your keys, not your Bitcoins,"" drum will be vindicated.",1624626297,Mark_Bear,True,1,79,2021-06-25

Bitcoin,"If you want Bitcoin to moon, then help get the first US BTC ETF approved by submitting a comment to the SEC","&gt;The Commission asks that commenters address the sufficiency of the Exchange‚Äôs statements in support of the proposal, which are set forth in the Notice,17 in addition to any other comments they may wish to submit about the proposed rule change. In particular, the Commission seeks comment on the following questions and asks commenters to submit data where appropriate to support their views:

&amp;#x200B;

1. What are commenters‚Äô views on whether the proposed Trust and Shares would be susceptible to manipulation? What are commenters‚Äô views generally on whether the Exchange‚Äôs proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices? What are commenters‚Äô views generally with respect to the liquidity and transparency of the bitcoin markets, the bitcoin markets‚Äô susceptibility to manipulation, and thus the suitability of bitcoin as an underlying asset for an exchange-traded product?
2. What are commenters‚Äô views of the Exchange‚Äôs assertion that regulatory and financial landscapes relating to bitcoin and other digital assets have changed significantly since 2016? 18 Are the changes that the Exchange identifies sufficient to support the determination that the proposed listing and trading of the Shares are consistent with the Act?
3. The Exchange states that ‚Äúapproving this proposal . . . \[would\] allow U.S. investors with access to bitcoin in a regulated and transparent exchange-traded vehicle that would act to limit risk‚Äù associated with retail exposure through other means.19 Further, the Exchange asserts that ‚Äúthe manipulation concerns previously articulated by the Commission are sufficiently mitigated to the point that they are outweighed by quantifiable investor protection issues.‚Äù20 What are commenters‚Äô view regarding such an assertion?
4. According to the Exchange, ‚Äú\[n\]early every measurable metric related to \[Chicago Mercantile Exchange‚Äôs\] Bitcoin Futures has trended consistently up since launch and/or accelerated upward in the past year.‚Äù21 Based on data provided and the academic research cited by the Exchange, do commenters agree that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (‚ÄúCME‚Äù) now represents a regulated market of significant size? 22 What are commenters‚Äô views on whether there is a reasonable likelihood that a person attempting to manipulate the Shares would also have to trade on CME to manipulate the Shares? What of the Exchange‚Äôs assertion that the combination of (a) CME bitcoin futures leading price discovery; (b) the overall size of the bitcoin market; and (c) the ability for market participants to buy or sell large amounts of bitcoin without significant market impact helps to prevent the Shares from becoming the predominant force on pricing in either the bitcoin spot or CME bitcoin futures markets?
5. What are commenters‚Äô views on the Exchange‚Äôs statement, generally, that bitcoin is resistant to price manipulation and that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices exist to justify dispensing with the requisite surveillance sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size related to bitcoin?24 What of the Exchange‚Äôs assertion in support of such statement that significant liquidity in the spot market and the decreasing impact of market orders on the overall price of bitcoin mean that attempting to move the price of bitcoin is costly? 25 What of the assertion that offering only in-kind creations and redemptions provides unique protections against potential attempts to manipulate the Shares and that the price the Sponsor uses to value the Trust‚Äôs bitcoin ‚Äúis not particularly important‚Äù?

Like many of thousands of people, I had some BTC from a wallet back in 2013 that I have long forgotten the password to.

I decided to go through an old hard drive to find any sign of a mnemonic, or a private key. 

I found a key of some sort in a text file that I clearly pasted, but it doesn't seem to be a private key, which is what I was hoping for...

5) Bitcoin is going to break out I don't when but not too long in the distant future.

Bitcoin,Why can't a stable coin have unlimited supply?," There has always been a big discussion about Tether and their reserves, or lack of. This week, it all started again. Same thing.

I agree with the fact that they should be honest and let a 3rd party do a proper audit. If they promised that 1 USDT would backed by 1 USD then they have to be able to prove they have those USDs in their bank account. It should be clear. Period.

Now let's forget about Tether and let's focus on why do stable coins exist. What is the point of having a stable coin? The whole point is so that you can trade your crypto for it if you fear the market would crash. You can keep it in a stable coin without having to put it in your bank account.

What I care as a crypto trader is that the stable coin actually delivers on the promise of keeping it's value constant. That's all I care as a crypto trader. That the value stays the same. 1 stable coin equals 1 USD today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

The problem with Tether is that they laid about their promise of keeping a 1 on 1 reserve.

But what if they wouldn't have had this 1 on 1 pegged promise.

What if they would have said instead, from the bigining: we have created a stable coin, it's pegged 1 to 1 with the US dollar. We don't keep reserves of USD. Why? Because we don't need to. Our promise to you is that 1 USDT will always equal 1 USD. We achieve that by using an oracle that always matches the price of USDT to the price of USD. That's it.

We will also have an uncapped supply. Does that impact you as a holder of USDT? No, it doesn't. Remember that the price will always be 1 USDT = 1 USD

Would that work in practice?

I would love to hear your opinion on this.

Bitcoin,At this point fuck Bitcoin (Let me explain),"At this point fuck Bitcoin. This perpetual sideways trading has opened my eyes to some things that I want to get off my chest. First, logical has left the building when it comes to trying to drawing a correlation between btc price and news. When El Salvador made btc legal tender (probably the biggest news in crypto history at this point) noting but crickets. Im realistic I didn't expect it to make a new all time high or even hit anywhere close to 60k but moving back to 45k and stating there at the very least would have made sense. Now Parguary has a bill to do the same. Still nothing.

Look at what happened to Nike stock price today after the earnings call. It doubled its earnings last quarter, and the stock price reacted accordingly by shooting up around 10% today. That makes sense. Thats healthy. I can understand that.

I think we need to starting coming to terms with the fact that Bitcoin is now out of the control of retail investors and is no longer following logic. Big money has taken over and they are clearly suppressing the price. I say its time the community comes together to find a smaller project that we can pump. Let's move on from btc and at the same time break this obnoxious connection between btc price and alt coin price. There is no reason anymore for every damn alt coin to dump when btc does.

Bitcoin,Daily Analysis + Forecast = 24.06.2021,"Starting today, I would like to share my daily work with great community here. I hope you find it beneficial. 

  
BTC rallied for 3 days. However, the candlestick theory and indicators suggests that the odds could swing bearish again. 

&amp;#x200B;

[BTC - Daily](https://preview.redd.it/dxmyelvz7c771.png?width=2510&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=975b4ff67754e5f28cd1da4fa2a8668cf0ee1c5c)

**Candles Perspective**

There were three green candles over the last three days. The last two were very weak and were made on a falling volume. At the same time, the price failed to close above 8 EMA (just 15 point below!) and close above the last long red candle.   
There are likely two notable combos in play, a Three While Soldiers and a **Falling 3 Methods**. While the former is not well supported by indicators, the latter has **the higher odds** of completing. If it is so, expect a sizeable red candle today-tomorrow, possibly closing at a lower low.   
The perspectives for tomorrow:  
\- If the coin closes above $35.7k, a reversal would be confirmed.  
\- If a red candle closes at a new low, the downtrend could accelerate.

**Elliot Waves Perspective**

BTC completed a minimally acceptable formation of 5 waves down that I marked with Blue on the daily chart. 

&amp;#x200B;

[BTC - 1hr](https://preview.redd.it/6e10paz48c771.png?width=2493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c85c6a3f048bec6fba4fe0d196ff8ee94537068c)

On the hourly chart I placed a rectangle that I consider an inflection area. If BTC advances through the rectangle, I would expect it to continue the rally and complete wave B by approximately the end of August (blue count on the daily chart). 

If the coin choses to continue down (odds slightly favor this scenario), it could complete wave (C) in Green or Alt (A) in Blue (daily chart) in the next several weeks. The targets for this scenario remain unchanged:

1. (C) = 0.618 x (A): **$19975**.   
Note that this target is just a tad above the Long Term support of **$19870.6**. If this support breaks, $BTC could see a 4-digit prices in the nearest future. The long term waves/forecast will require a full recount if LT support breaks.
2. (C) = 0.786 x (A): **$14176**. 
3. (C) = 1.0 x (A): **$6789**. 

**Long Term Forecast:**  
Both Green and Blue scenarios have been on the long term chart for a while. It looks like this month a decision will be made.

Bitcoin,Onboarding New Bitcoin (satoshis) Users through the Lightning Network - Be Involved," I discovered the Lightning Network in the past week. I had heard of it but it seemed rather complicated. The happenings in El Salvadore however set me off to find out how it works and how I could be involved.

In the early days of Bitcoin, for me 2014, we could set up online Businesses (opportunities) that could use Bitcoin as the transaction fees were acceptable and the confirmation times reasonable. Come 2016/17, the fees rose to very high levels and the confirmations took for ever or never happened for small amount transactions. This caused the death of many online businesses that had set up using Bitcoin. They have never recovered but they now have a chance through the lightning Network. At that time I managed to introduce close to 2,000 people to Bitcoin in my country. They hated me then but today they are grateful for what I ""forced"" them into. I was running a Network Marketing Platform.

I have always believed that Crypto can only really explode through a Network Marketing process. A Network marketing process introduces people to the prospect of earning some money and they sign up and they then have to refer their friends who have to refer their friends. It could grow fairly quickly. The Catch in this case is that it is using the lightning Network!

For the love of me, what is the Lightning Network! They have no choice but to get to know what it is. They have to know how to get an LN wallet, how to top it up, how to make a payment, how to withdraw and how to convert to the Local Currency.

Except for those who have access to Strike, this is really a complicated process! The desire to make money though is strong. Human Greed is a great motivator. This is the route I intend to use to spread the Bitcoin Gospel. My Twitter handle at MusthaveCrypto is already doing this for Bitcoin although I am yet to start on LN as I am still trying to fully understand the basics myself.

Where do you as an LN come in? I would like to invite you to sign up. When you do, you will have the opportunity to help grow the Network.

&amp;#x200B;

[http:\/\/helpmepaymybills.club\/login.php](https://preview.redd.it/glpd7z5cmb771.png?width=1122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36b5e1bcbc7acca2ddf85688d3a781093e68cda0)

You could also make a donation so that we can activate free members who are already signed up.

I know that many people label MLM as a Scam. If that was my intention, I would use a simpler payment method. We all have opinions and if the equivalent of $7 is too much to be ""scammed"", then I would advise that you do not get involved.

This community should already understand how to get LN to function. I believe that if we were to get involved, we could grow by at least 100 new people daily.

My Platform is still being refined and is all manual for now. I am getting my developer to look at the API to see what can be automated safely. I therefore request that you be patient and allow for at least 24hrs for the process of activation and withdrawal to happen.

Visit the platform and let us hear your comments. I will post in this thread as I get a better understanding of LN.

The goings on in El Salvadore have gotten me rather excited. Strike is a real Game Changer and I can't wait for it to be available in my country. The cost of MPESA is too high but we have no choice. Strike would kill MPESA in a very short time. I see a lot of resistance being waged against Strike but WHO CAN stop LN? Who?

Bitcoin,"By popular demand: a deep-dive analysis of media sentiment surrounding bitcoin over the past 90 days (3/25-6/23),","We will analyze Bitcoin‚Äôs news conversation over the past 90 days, and determine whether it‚Äôs currently overhyped or if now is the time to snipe.

In 2021 $BTC price has followed a head and shoulders pattern, starting the year at $30K, doubling to an elated peak of $63K per coin in mid-April, and falling back down to the $30K-$40K price range in recent weeks (the past 90 days are shown in the chart above). Some speculate that this puzzling performance is indicative of institutional manipulation (search ‚ÄúWycoff BTC‚Äù on Twitter

One thing is for sure over the past 90 days: Bitcoin has gone from an emotional high of significant optimism to one of the most pessimistic and fearful tickers on the internet, and it has taken the entire cryptocurrency market with it. As of today, the investor sentiment Fear &amp; Greed Index points to ‚Äúextreme fear‚Äù 

over the past 90 days Bitcoin news sentiment has trended definitively downwards, falling below the neutral line from optimistic to pessimistic just last week.

Overall, $BTC was still more optimistic and less speculative than both the FAANG stocks and S&amp;P 500 in the news over the last 90 days.

we can see a clear correlation between the weekly price of Bitcoin and its news sentiment and time-sense.

Bitcoin‚Äôs news sentiment showed a 0.496 correlation with price (considered significant), and Bitcoin‚Äôs news time-sense showed a -0.766 correlation with price (a strong correlation) over the past 90 days.

news is more reactive and past-oriented when things are going good, but when things take a turn downwards, news articles tend become more speculative. 

So where does this leave us?

This is the part of the report where we determine if Bitcoin is currently overhyped in the news (and due for a correction), or if it‚Äôs underhyped and time to put some money into it. We call this our Hype-Or-Snipe scale, 

Based on our analysis, we have determined that Bitcoin is currently SLIGHTLY undervalued in the news, and receives a Hype-Or-Snipe rating of +0.05.

Bitcoin,Received free Sats from Cashapp. Time to give it away on Lightning.,"I will help you onto lightning by giving away bitcoin. Seriously. (I stole this idea and post from someone else)

Lightning Network gets a lot of fud even here in this sub. I suspect a lot of you guys haven‚Äôt yet actually tried it. It really is a lot easier than i think most people expect, and here is me trying to prove it. 
I suspect that the big hurdle right now is that you have to move your coins onto the lightning Network, so the idea behind this post is actually giving away MY satoshis so you do not have to do this to experience lightning. Hopefully some other experienced lightning-users will join me if this ends up a costly adventure. (Please lets keep this thread  focused on giving people the first experience with lightning)

HERE‚ÄôS the plan:
-Go download Wallet of satoshi. This is a really really easy lightning Wallet. It IS custodial, but ignore that for now

-post your adress/qr here. I will send you 200 sats as soon as I can. I will answer you when i do,  and if I don‚Äôt get to tired I‚Äôll post how many Sats it cost to send. IF someone else wants to join me, just send sats, and answer the post in the same way.

-when you recieve the sats, congratz! You have bitcoin in the lightning Network. Find a friend, pay it forward.

-Should you choose to explore this further, go download breez Wallet. You now have a non-custodial Wallet, and you can create an invoice (recieve via invoice) for yourself and pay from Wallet of satoshi and my sats. No risk, its someone elses money. You have now made your first transaction and are probably starting to Get it.

-With the sats well placed in breez, go to the apps-section from the top left corner. Pick the lightning roulette app,  fund with 20(!) sats (press ¬´open in Wallet¬ª), and gamble HALF of your deposit. Then go to the menu and press ¬´withdraw using webln¬ª, and watch your remaining sats return to your breez balance. How cool is that?

-now: IF you want to experiment with moving YOUR coin onto breez, you have to make an on-chain transaction(recieve via btc adress) but breez assumes that you want any bitcoin on the lightning Network, and any recieved coin wil be on lightning. There are fees.",1624569726,Eislemike,True,1,314,2021-06-25
Bitcoin,Trying to Orange Pill an Older Relative by Giving a Formal Presentation,"Hi Bitcoin Team!

I've got an older relative and I want him to increase his bitcoin position to around 5-10% of his portfolio, while making possible for him to sleep at night and ignore the media FUD/ volatility.  He has a small position in Bitcoin rn but he gets annoyed whenever I talk about it.  He's funny because he tells me I'm obsessed when I bring it up. So I don't bring it up, and then he brings it up!

I told him that I'd like to just have an in-depth conversation about it in a few days and then after that, we can shelf the conversation entirely.

So here's where you come in! I'd like to prepare some google slides that I can present to him formally and when I make them, I'd be happy to share them here for your use as well.

I need links to short video clips from influential people, quotes, and links to important charts. (Money supply and other charts about the financial system/ no TA, although I'll explain S2F to him)  


This is the structure I'm imagining right now, which I'm hoping to abridge into a 20-30 minute presentation:  


1) Quick overview of the financial crisis from a macro perspective. Just the main points, skipping over stuff he already knows.

2) What is QE?

3) How this was a backdrop for Bitcoin to be created

4) A brief overview of Satoshi, Cypherpunks, and the Sound Money protocol/ how it works. (the ledger, the halving cycle, mining, the difficulty adjustment, cryptography, and fully validating nodes)  I don't want to go to deep into any of this, so I'll probably make some comparisons to things he can understand and just scratch the surface. He should be left with the idea that this is new technology and pretty exciting stuff.

5) Stock to Flow, what is it and how bitcoin has tracked the price.  I'll tell him about Plan B, the anonymous Dutch institutional investor, which is an interesting story.

5) The interest rates in Europe going negative, what that means, and how we're headed there in the states.

5) Quotes from Billionaires on Bitcoin. I'd like to gather some one-line quips from Ray Dahlio, Stanly Druckenmiller, Paul Tudor Jones.

6) Explaining a Store of Value, the properties of money from Preston Pysh's inteview with Robert Breedlove, and why bitcoin's hard cap and decentralization positions Bitcoin to uniquely be the best store of value humanity has ever created.

6) The best short (around a minute) Michael Saylor Video Clip. After which, I will explain that Michael Saylor is a MIT Alum, Billionaire CEO/ early investor in Apple, who understands networks and networks effects on a master-class level.  I will tell him about Michael Saylor's position in Bitcoin on his company's balance sheet, how he doubled down during the recent dip, and what he's doing to bring in the institutional investors.

7) A short clip of Jack Dorsey's interview at the Bitcoin Conference. ""absolutely, its the only way out""

8) A short clip of Chamath Palahaptiya calling Bitcoin ""shmuck insurance"" on the news.

9) Energy FUD and why Bitcoin incentivizes clean, cheap energy. Changing the bird's eye perspective on energy.

10) Bitcoin in El Salvador, the lightning network, and a brief explanation of Bitcoin's game theory. I might tack on the reasons that I don't like ETH and why altcoins are irrelevant for him. Quick explanation of layered money.

11) I'll maybe close it with the idea that bitcoin is a speculative asset class, but it is also a growing network, with the intrinsic value being the network itself.  I'll explain that just like a Microsoft words utility is to help you make documents, Bitcoin's utility is:

Sound Money without Centralized Manipulation

Store of Value

Transfer of Value/ Settlement

Smart Contracts

Second Layer Network Technology

Financial Sovereignty for the Unbanked (and banked alike)

Access to a growing Asset class without real estate, wall street, or any third parties.

And we're barely scratching the surface.

  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Anything you think I missed from a deep orange pill perspective?  Anything you think I should skip? and finally, please link any convincing charts, video clips, or websites that might help me make this?  


Just to clarify, I'm not trying to make y'all do the research work for me, but I'd like to make an awesome short presentation and I know that your perspective will help me craft this into a banger.  Maybe I'll even turn this into an Orange pill vid when all is said and done and I'll happily share the google sheets.",1624569712,filmrebelroby,True,1,32,2021-06-25

Bitcoin,Question to a bitcoin maximalist: How do you solve this?,"How does Bitcoin solve this? Especially since more than half of Bitcoin haven't been moved within a year. And the last update basically removed some of the ability to identify bitcoin stored for very long.

Are you aware that the adoption of bitcoin as a currency means that at some point (since a currency is generally used to transmit the information for some exchange of value) you are actually eligible to an equal amount of value to the amount of bitcoin you possess? 

Whatever inflation can happen with $ or ‚Ç¨ is nothing compared to when some of the whales starts to spend their bitcoin. Martin Shkrelis overpriced drugs are harmless compared to this leverage the bitcoin industry has.

I see bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency for that matter) dead in the water if it isn't correlated to any existing distribution of value of the whole market or some part of market. Bitcoin is to small right now to really see that effect but the moment some countries have adopted bitcoin as a currency you guys have to be very responsible spenders if you don't want to be responsible for an upcoming crisis! (I'm just guessing that almost none of you whales has any participation in any real world economic endeavor proportionally to the amount of bitcoin you possess.) Thus the more bitcoin is spread the more there will be resistance in adopting it.

At least a few years back , biggest problem for Bitcoin was transaction speed. It could take days to validate transactions at the height of 2017 madness. 

Has the above problem now been solved? If only partially solved, then what % are we talking about now, 50%, 80% or 20%? As I understand the Lightning Network has been implemented more than a year ago by now. Is Bitcoin transfer speed now competitive with Visa or we are still far away from that point?

Its June 24, 2021 and Bitcoin just rocketed to $35,000 on the news that NYC will soon be adopting bitcoin to try to stop the hemmorhage of talent fleeing for Miami, Austin, etc and their more bitcoin friendly environments.

Bershire Hathaway is currently at $415,600 per share and is sitting on a mountain of rapidly self destructing fiat that they can't deploy because Buffet is out to lunch and his political influence is weakening as he ages and is surpassed by the younger more intelligent generation.     Berkshire has some businesses (namely insurance, real estate, and financial services) that will be pummeled by bitcoin.  He also has many name brand low margin businesses that will be harmed by crushing inflation and woke identity politics.

But if I follow Michael Saylor's logic, the US for the next 10 years will add 15% to the money supply every year, so I get the following \*rough\* math.

I took 85%\^10 (15% inflation each year over 10 years) = .196 \* 406K \~ $80K worth of actual buying power on the $406K on paper. Is that right?

Whereas if I liquidate 100K today, pay 40% taxes and then buy roughly 2 BTC, if BTC grows 10% / year and I still do my 10K contribution, the value of my BTC will be \~ $330K with $330K of buying power.

Is that his argument for why storing value in currency (my 401K, which is similar to his treasury) is a terrible idea?

With China ""banning"" Bitcoin mining, apparently the price of used ASIC miners is plunging, to the point where Bitmain is supposedly stopping sales of new hardware. Anyone have any good resources as to price/performance/availability of devices in this sector?

Bitfarms ($BITF), based out of Canada, is a Bitcoin mining company. They just IPO'd on the nasdaq Monday. Currently trading around $4.50 per share. They' mined 11,300 BTC since 2017. All mining operations use 100% renewable energy.

SOS Limited ($SOS), based out of China, just recently got involved in crypto. They have recently entered into a joint venture with Niagra development LLC, based out of New Jersey (US), to begin BTC mining operations in the U.S. They have ETH rigs still in China unaffected by the crackdown. More than 90% of their crypto mining rigs use renewable energy. They are also in the process of developing a digital currency exchange (like a Coinbase). And use Blockchain technology for their emergency services offered in China. Currently trading around $3.40 a share. They confirmed Q1 mining produced 42 BTC and 918 ETH. They have since added 10,000+ additional rigs.

Bitcoin,Warning of account closure at Bitwala / Nuri / Solarisbank,"I herby warn everyone from opening and using an account at [Nuri.com](https://Nuri.com) (ex Bitwala). I'm a user of their product since the early days. They have always delivered a great product, building a bridge between fiat and crypto (especially Bitcoin).

Bitwala recently re-named themselves to Nuri and partnered with Solaris Bank to and Celsius to provide an interest account for Bitcoin and a standard bank account with a bridge to a Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet.

So far so good. A few days after renaming Bitwala to Nuri I received an email with tons of questions, here are some of them:

&gt;**Do you use this account as a main account or do you plan to do so in the future?‚Ä¢ Are there persons other than yourself who got access to this account?‚Ä¢ Which occupation do you have and what is your employment relationship (e.g. employed, self-employed, freelancer, student, without employment)?‚Ä¢ How high is your monthly disposable income?‚Ä¢ How would you estimate your crypto knowledge?

which I found extremely intimidating and privacy concerning. Although I was not comfortable with answering those questions, I did. After a week I received this email:

Don't trust banks.

I want to add an additional warning regarding their interest account (or any other interest account like Blockfi, Celcius and co.).

Terms of service of Bitwala (now NURI):

&gt;**Special risk factors for the Crypto Interest Account**  
&gt;  
&gt;Investing cryptocurrencies via the Crypto Interest Account is associated with significant risks. The risks described below can occur individually or cumulatively. For the customer (""investor"") there is the risk of total loss. The order in which the risks are presented does not provide any indication of the materiality of the risks, either in terms of their probability of occurrence or in terms of their impact on the investor and his claims.  
&gt;  
&gt;The further risk information on cryptocurrencies in ¬ß 8 of our General Terms and Conditions ([https://www.bitwala.com/de/terms-of-service/](https://www.bitwala.com/de/terms-of-service/)) must be observed.  
&gt;  
&gt;**1. No deposit insurance**  
&gt;  
&gt;There is no statutory or voluntary deposit insurance for the cryptocurrencies invested via the Crypto Interest Account. In the event of a default by Celsius Network Limited (Celsius Network), no payments will be made to the investors by third parties (e.g. a deposit protection fund (‚ÄúEinlagensicherungsfonds‚Äù). Bitwala GmbH (""Bitwala"" or ""we"") also does not provide compensation in the event of loss of the cryptocurrencies used and does not accept any other securities.  
&gt;  
&gt;**2. Bankruptcy of Celsius Network**  
&gt;  
&gt;The investors bear the full risk of the bankruptcy of Celsius Network. Celsius Network is the sole debtor of the investors' claims to the agreed income and repayment of the amount of cryptocurrencies used. Whether Celsius Network will be able to fulfil the due claims of the investors in the future depends solely on the success of its business activities. If Celsius Network becomes illiquid (e.g. in the event of bankruptcy), the investor will suffer a total loss of his investment as well as any income already earned but not yet disbursed.  
&gt;  
&gt;**3. No participation, co-determination or control rights**  
&gt;  
&gt;Investors have no rights of participation, co-determination or control with regard to the business activities and business strategy of Celsius Network. Investors cannot verify whether Celsius Network conducts business activities that will enable it to service the claims of investors from the Crypto Interest Account in the future. The business activities carried out by Celsius Network may result in further risks for investors. As investors do not know the business activities of Celsius Network in detail, they are not in a position to verify these potential risks. Celsius Network could make decisions that could have an impact on the investors. The investors have no possibility to influence the business activities of Celsius Network. This also applies to the use of the cryptocurrencies provided.  
&gt;  
&gt;**4. No state supervision**  
&gt;  
&gt;Celsius Network is registered as a Money Service Business (""MSB"") with the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a unit within the US Department of the Treasury that collects and analyses information on financial transactions in order to combat national and international money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes. Nevertheless, Celsius Network and its business activities are not subject to extensive government supervision. In particular, there is no guarantee that registration with FinCEN will meet German standards of comparable governmental supervision. There is therefore no state or other protection for investors against misuse of the cryptocurrencies provided.  
&gt;  
&gt;**5. Application of foreign law and prosecution abroad**  
&gt;  
&gt;The legal relationship between the investor and Celsius Network is governed by US law / the law of the United Kingdom. Investors may not be aware of the law and may therefore not be able to exercise their legal position under the respective laws vis-aÃÄ-vis Celsius Network or not exercise it properly. Claims of investors against Celsius Network must be asserted in foreign courts. For investors this may mean higher costs and difficulties in enforcing their claims.  
&gt;  
&gt;**6. Price and earnings volatility**  
&gt;  
&gt;The investor bears the risk of exchange rate volatilities with regard to the cryptocurrencies provided by him. The price of cryptocurrencies on corresponding trading platforms can be subject to high volatility. The investor has a claim against Celsius Network for repayment of the amount of cryptocurrencies provided by him plus the agreed income. This entails the risk that the cryptocurrencies provided by the investor may have a lower value at the time of repayment than at the time of transfer to Celsius Network.  
&gt;  
&gt;The interest rate for calculating the returns on the cryptocurrencies provided is subject to weekly changes by Celsius Network. Medium- or long-term planning with regard to the amount of income is therefore not possible. For the investor, there is the risk that the interest rate will decrease after the cryptocurrencies have been transferred to Celsius Network.  
&gt;  
&gt;**7. Tax risks**  
&gt;  
&gt;The current tax treatment of the income has not been conclusively clarified and may also depend on the individual tax treatment of the respective investor. It cannot be ruled out that the tax authorities and courts may adjust or change previous tax assessments on the treatment of income with cryptocurrencies. It is also not clear whether the previously applicable principles for the tax treatment of trading in crypto-currencies can be applied to income from the Crypto Interest Account.  
&gt;  
&gt;Note:Bitwala does not provide investment advice to the client. Bitwala does not verify whether the Crypto Interest Account is a suitable investment for investors in view of their personal investment objectives and financial circumstances. Bitwala also does not provide any corresponding recommendations. Bitwala also does not conduct a reasonable assessment as to whether the Crypto Interest Account is appropriate in view of the knowledge and experience of the investor.

How this posts stops a few people of opening an account with Bitwala / Nuri in the first place. Take care everyone, this is why we are all in Bitcoin and Blockchain!",1624532041,eminogrande,True,1,16,2021-06-24

Lightning could work to exchange currencies, for instance Litecoin and BTC. So, then what about Liquid?

Liquid is not quite as safe as on-chain but it is safe enough for reasonable amounts. So what if people could accept Liquid channels with a slight surcharge to account for the slightly larger risk. If that surcharge is less than than what can be made from fees then it could be a good deal. Also, the surcharge can be a constant which makes things a lot simpler.

This would make it feasible to rebalance the network cheaply and onboard lots of new clients.

Bitcoin,After Years of ASIC Manufacturing Canaan Expands to Bitcoin Mining in Kazakhstan,"Canaan Inc., the crypto mining rig manufacturer based in Beijing, has announced the company plans to mine cryptocurrencies in Kazakhstan. The company says that the firm‚Äôs next-generation Avalonminer mining rigs are already deployed in the world‚Äôs largest landlocked country.

Canaan Joins the Bitcoin Mining Fray
The publicly-listed company Canaan (Nasdaq: CAN) has revealed the firm is entering the fray of bitcoin mining with its own self-operated mining business. Canaan is one of the oldest bitcoin mining hardware manufacturers in the world as it was founded by Nangeng Zhang in 2013.

In the company‚Äôs earliest years it created FPGA miners dedicated to Bitcoin‚Äôs SHA256 consensus algorithm. Fast forward to today and the company is one of the top application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) makers, up there with Bitmain, Microbt, and Ebang.

A recent wired.co.uk report highlights statements from Didar Bekbauov, founder of the Kazakhstan-based Xive, when he said last April that Chinese mining companies have been regularly seeking out plots in the country to set up shop.
On Wednesday, the Beijing-based company revealed it will be leveraging its Avalonminers to mine bitcoin in Kazakhstan. The move follows the firm opening up an ASIC mining rig service center in the transcontinental country.

The announcement on Wednesday explains that the move to start mining bitcoin after expanding the company‚Äôs manufacturing process is ‚Äúthe next logical step.‚Äù The entry into the field of mining will ‚Äúoptimize its revenues, as well as strengthen its inventory management and supply chain capabilities,‚Äù the company states.

‚ÄúWe believe that our self-operated bitcoin mining business will help us improve our financial performance as well as expand our business scope and customer base,‚Äù Canaan‚Äôs founder Zhang stated during the announcement. ‚ÄúAs we integrate more industry resources into our operations, we believe this business segment will enable us to revitalize our mining machine inventory, shield us from bitcoin volatility, and ensure our inventory sufficiency during market upturns.‚Äù

A few of Canaan‚Äôs manufacturing competitors have been in the mining space for years, specifically Bitmain. The China-based mining rig company Bitmain has been operating a pool called Antpool since 2013. Today, Bitmain‚Äôs Antpool is one of the largest pools dedicating hashrate to the BTC chain.

Canaan says it will also benefit from taking full advantage of the availability of its ‚Äúin-stock mining machines to be actively deployed in its mining operations at low electricity rates, thus maximising its computing power at that time.‚Äù

‚ÄúOn the flip side,‚Äù Canaan concluded, ‚Äúwhen market activity is elevated, the mining business will also benefit from putting the processing capacity of older machines in use. The net result will be a considerable improvement in inventory planning and supply chain optimization throughout the year and unaffected by the price of bitcoin.‚Äù Canaan added:

Bitcoin,What do you think ?,"The decision by El Salvador was a big decision with far-reaching implications for its citizens. However, it is possible the decision could significantly impact individuals subject to the United States Internal Revenue Code. All US guidance issued to date have correctly pointed out that bitcoin is not the legal tender of any jurisdiction (see FIN-2013-G001 and Notice 2014-21). This statement will soon not be true!

The US government has used the legal tender distinction as a way to apply a different set of rules to ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù currency compared to ‚Äúreal‚Äù currency. It has been the government‚Äôs view to date that ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù currency, a term that currently encompasses cryptocurrency and bitcoin, is property and the taxation rules related to property apply. The question being pressed by El Salvador‚Äôs decision to adopt bitcoin as legal tender is does El Salvador‚Äôs decision have any impact on how bitcoin is treated by the IRS?",1624525563,_kr_saurabh,True,2,4,2021-06-24

CypherpunkPay claims to prioritize **simplicity** and **privacy**.

It's a single Linux daemon with no hard dependencies. Installation and updates are easy with official packages available for Ubuntu and Debian.

Connecting a full node is highly encouraged but optional - CypherpunkPay is **instant-on** with mature support for scanning the blockchain for incoming payments over Tor with help of external block explorers in a randomized fashion. Users can start easy and upgrade when ready.

Bitcoin,Please help me speculate on the 2021 Bull Run top. How would you calculate it using the data I provided?," 

As the Title reads I am trying to guess what the 2021 bullrun top for Bitcoin might be based off historical data.

This bullrun cycle is acting like the 2013 bullrun where where had 2 tops and 2 crashes. Based off 2013 and the top and bottom of the 1st top for 2021 I want to try to guess what the 2nd top will be.

Here is my data - I assume in my data that the bottom of the first top for 2021 took place the other day when bitcoin hit 28600 obviously if we go below that this weekend it would change the outcome.

The Known:

2013 Double Top

10-20-11 through 4-10-13 Bullrun top1 from $2.22 to $259.34 a 11,581.98% Increase

7-6-13 through 11-30-13 Bullrun top2 from $63 to $1163 a 1,746% Increase

2021 Double Top ??

12-15-19 through 4-14-21 Bullrun top1 from $3,122.28 to $64,895.22 a 1,978% Increase

6-22-21 through ??? Sept 23? Bullrun top2 from $28,600 to $$ ?? a ??% Increase

How would you use the data above to calculate the 2021 Bull run top?

the two numbers I have gotten is a $291,020 or $103,878.30

First is based off the % difference between the 2013 tops and use the 2021 Top1 to Calculate top2 there is a 348.66% difference from $259.34 vs $1163

Second is based off the percent difference of percentages based off 2013 top1 and 2021 top1 using that to find the percent of top2 and use that to calculate the 2nd top for 2021. which is a -84.9249% difference from 2013 top1 vs 2021 top1 so -84.9249% of 1746% is 263.211%",1624519696,pjman7,True,1,20,2021-06-24

I joined the intro tier because I don't like annual fees. The initial charge to open the account was $21. I've spent about $400 over nearly 20 transactions with an average transaction greater than $20. My total bitcoin rewards equals 5,119 sats valued at $1.68 today.

Bitcoin,Hard Fork vs Soft Fork - Comparison for a Beginner,"Forks are needed to allow innovation to take place in blockchaing - with no central figure in charge, development is up to the community and forks allow the implementation of these changes. These mechanisms allow the industry as a whole to adapt, grow and prosper, and all in a decentralized nature. The following guide breaks down the difference between a hard fork and a soft fork: [The Difference Between A Hard Fork And A Soft Fork](https://www.oobit.com/blog/the-difference-between-a-hard-fork-and-a-soft-fork/)

The biggest difference between a hard a soft forks is the backward-compatibility. With hard forks, the network is split into two and users need to pick which network they want to continue with. With soft forks, the network‚Äôs rules are updated but the chains can co-exist and older nodes (ones that have not updated) can still participate in verifying transactions. In soft forks, users are generally unaware of the updates and can continue to use the network and cryptocurrency as usual.",1624509813,thumbsdrivesmecrazy,True,1,0,2021-06-24
Bitcoin,Shorting should require someone to stake the coins,"In stocks and bitcoin, assets sitting on exchange can be made available by the exchange to others for shorting.  With some stock brokerages you can specify that your shares cannot be lent out, or you can put in a limit order at some ridiculous price level so that now the shares are locked up.  With BTC obviously you can move your money out of the exchange and into storage, but so many do not.

The process should be different.  For both stocks and for coins.  You should have to stake the asset to make it available, and then at least some of the interest should be paid to you for doing so.  Obviously these assets will not be available to you to trade while staked.

It seems like the honest way to do things.  Otherwise you end up with naked shorting and lots of shady stuff.  Because so much coin sits on exchanges, shorts will always be able to just sell, sell, sell, and bring the price down and then cover, rinse, repeat.  As long as there are people that will pick up these lower prices so the shorts can cover it will keep happening.  

The other problem is there is no buying momentum.  So you just have shorts shorting, and opportunistic buyers.  You could make the argument that coins moved ‚ÄúFrom weak hands to strong hands‚Äù, so eventually it will all come to a support level, but the reality is, whatever ‚Äúhands‚Äù bought the coins just keep them on the exchange in many cases, so they are just continuously available to keep being shorted‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..it never ends.",1624508848,bfeeny,True,1,6,2021-06-24

Bitcoin,Found this guy's flash drive and wallet.dat file in my house,"I asked my mom if she had any USB  drives laying around. She gave me one she says she bought for my brother  that he used for school. I plugged it in and sat there for a moment  wondering why there was a ""PS4"" folder (no one in my family has a  playstation), and also who this guy is (My family is white.) Then I saw  the dat file which I immediately recognized as a bitcion or crypto  wallet.

All the files are from  around 2016 which is when my brother started school. The ""immunization  record form"" is blank but it has a University of Maryland header which is the same school my brother went to. I guess somehow he ended up with  this guy's flash drive without realizing it and the drive, and possibly  this guy's crypto, has been sitting in a drawer in our house ever since.

Oh, and there's malware on it from a cracked game he torrented. I clicked on a folder and windows defender recognized  some scary looking malware to which I almost shit myself over. I'd go  through it more but would rather not have it connected to my computer  considering I don't know whose it is or how it got in our house.

Anyone know him tho

Bitcoin,Question for Cryptos,"So having followed the start of the pop culture fascination with various crypto currencies, I have been very tentative about getting involved. 

This has nothing to do with investing in crypto to make money. If you can time the market, you can make money on anything and I envy you, and wish you the best.

If this is covered extensively elsewhere, you can just post links to these questions.

Essentially the issues with cryptocurrencies as a true international currency from my reading seem to be:
1) No real economy will allow a crypto currency to be an equivalent because it would be a currency that cannot be controlled by the government and thus prevent them from managing/controlling inflation.

2) The fluctuating value of cryptocurrencies makes it difficult to use as a legal tender because most businesses operate on very slim margins and the possibility of a 5-25% swing in value would make it difficult for most companies who need reliable income and cannot sit on money for the market to come around.

3) Because of the nature of the blockchain, if you have the will, theoretically every purchase is completely visible to anyone. While I don‚Äôt think anyone cares about someone like me, theoretically for people who are ultra high net worth, the idea that any purchase is traceable could be less than appealing.

Not sure if I recapitulated think points well enough, but hopefully y‚Äôall get my point.

Bitcoin,Two blockchain bills pass in the US House POLITICS," From The Block:

""On Tuesday night, the [Consumer Safety Technology Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3723/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22S%22%5D%7D&amp;r=7&amp;s=1) passed in the House of Representatives. Two of its three titles were [blockchain and crypto-focused bills](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/106163/rep-soto-prepares-suite-of-crypto-legislation-for-return-to-congress) from Representative Darren Soto (D-Fl), while the third focuses on regulating AI.

Soto's bills had previously passed in the House, only to be shelved amid the political maelstrom that surrounded the end of the last Congress and the presidential election. Their passage this early in the current Congress will at the very least give the Senate more time to consider them than they had last time around.¬†

The Blockchain Innovation Act would require the Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, to put together a report on blockchain's use in trade and, especially, to fight fraud. On the House floor last night, Soto described the bill as ""a first step towards our long-term goal of setting up a Blockchain Center of Excellence in the Department of Commerce.""

The Digital Taxonomy Act ‚Äî not to be confused with Warren Davidson's Token Taxonomy Act ‚Äî starts with the proposition that ""the use of digital tokens and blockchain technology is likely to increase in the future."" It subsequently mandates that the FTC assemble a report on unfair and deceptive practices in crypto markets.¬†

The legislation's progress comes on the heels of major public attention on illicit use of cryptocurrencies following high-profile ransomware attacks like [Colonial Pipeline](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/107496/us-official-says-majority-of-bitcoin-paid-by-colonial-pipeline-after-ransomware-attack-has-been-recovered) and JBS.

The fate of these bills in the Senate remains to be seen. The House has attracted a growing number of crypto advocates over the years, but the Senate, which faces less frequent turnover and hosts far fewer lawmakers, has shown less interest in blockchain regulation. That may [also be changing](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/107983/senator-elizabeth-warren-attacks-cryptocurrency-over-ransomware-energy-use), though not necessarily in a way favorable to the industry.¬†""",1624496483,City_Runner,True,1,3,2021-06-24

Bitcoin,Is the bitcoin halving cycle being invalidated?,"We are all aware by now that historically, halving dates are the start of bull cycles. This belief was further strengthened by the arrival of the S2F and S2Fx model of PlanB. 

Mathematically or statistically, the way S2F and S2Fx were done is pretty dubious. You can further read about it here. [S2F](https://www.coindesk.com/why-the-stock-to-flow-bitcoin-valuation-model-is-wrong)

To summarize that, the S2F model is too linear or too predicated into a single aspect of asset valuation. 

That S2F model may have work in determining 2013 and 2017 runs because retailers are still king during those times. With the arrival of institutions and corporations and even nations, the valuation of bitcoin may not be as easy as before.

So, that prompted the question, are we are already in the process of invalidating the four-year cycles? Meaning, halving dates' impact will be getting lesser by the days and bitcoin will now be traded like a usual asset like gold, fiat and etc. Wherein cycles are determined by different macro things, not only stock-to-flow ratio.

I think this can be confirmed if we will continue to be below $50K for the next three-four months, and then we still end up creating a new ATH next year. Although, a much harder confirmation will be a new ATH by 2023 or simply, a weak bear market. 

The invalidation of the halving cycles has a lot of pros and cons. But the biggest thing for me is simply the possibility that bitcoin will now be traded just like how every other store-of-value-assets are being traded.

That way, we can have a much clearer picture of how it really differentiates itself from gold and fiat.",1624495704,bigmatch,True,1,9,2021-06-24

Bitcoin,One BENEFIT of a market downturn: You can save a TON of $$$ on your taxes with this one simple crypto loop hole,"**One benefit of a market downturn:** You can save a TON of $$$ on your tax bill for next year with this one simple crypto tax loop hole. Let's discuss...

If you sell or trade your crypto when it is below the price you originally acquired it for, you incur a capital loss. Capital losses get deducted from capital gains on your taxes, and overall, they reduce your taxable income for the year.

**E.g.** Let's say you bought bitcoin at $55,000 a month ago. If you sold or traded that BTC at market prices today ($32,000), you would lock in a capital loss for the year and significantly lower your taxes.

But it gets even better: Because the IRS classifies cryptocurrency as property and NOT as a security, ""wash sale"" rules do not apply to crypto as they do for stocks. This means you can buy the BTC that you sold back immediately and still realize the capital loss.

This is even MORE important if you have incurred gains earlier this year. Remember, capital losses deduct from capital gains on your tax return during the year they were realized. So if you've already ""realized gains"", you should take losses if possible to offset these gains.

**E.g.** Let's say you traded ETH for [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=cashtag_click) at the height of the market. In doing this, you realized a taxable event and likely huge taxable gains as ETH was at all time highs. However, now your [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=cashtag_click) is underwater (worth less than you got it for).

So, if you sell out of [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=cashtag_click) today, and then immediately buy it back, you will realize losses and offset a lot of those gains that you realized from your trade of ETH to [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=cashtag_click) This could save you a TON on your taxes. I know someone who reduced his tax bill by $43,000 by doing this!

This is a process known as Tax Loss Harvesting, and it's a strategy rich people use all the time to lower their capital gains tax bill every year (more info [on TLH here](https://cryptotrader.tax/blog/cryptocurrency-tax-loss-harvesting)).

Also, you can use crypto tax software tools like CryptoTrader.Tax or BitTaxer to automatically detect your biggest tax savings opportunities for you. (The tools cost money, but you can test them out for free)

**So in summary:** Take a look at your current positions and see if there is any opportunity to ""harvest"" losses. Doing this proactively can lead to HUGE tax savings for next year.",1624495240,stratguy56,True,1,51,2021-06-24

Bitcoin,"Before approving the VANECK Bitcoin ETF, the SEC needs your view on the following","&gt;The Commission asks that commenters address the sufficiency of the Exchange‚Äôs statements in support of the proposal, which are set forth in the Notice,17 in addition to any other comments they may wish to submit about the proposed rule change. In particular, the Commission seeks comment on the following questions and asks commenters to submit data where appropriate to support their views:

&amp;#x200B;

1. What are commenters‚Äô views on whether the proposed Trust and Shares would be susceptible to manipulation? What are commenters‚Äô views generally on whether the Exchange‚Äôs proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices? What are commenters‚Äô views generally with respect to the liquidity and transparency of the bitcoin markets, the bitcoin markets‚Äô susceptibility to manipulation, and thus the suitability of bitcoin as an underlying asset for an exchange-traded product?
2. What are commenters‚Äô views of the Exchange‚Äôs assertion that regulatory and financial landscapes relating to bitcoin and other digital assets have changed significantly since 2016? 18 Are the changes that the Exchange identifies sufficient to support the determination that the proposed listing and trading of the Shares are consistent with the Act?
3. The Exchange states that ‚Äúapproving this proposal . . . \[would\] allow U.S. investors with access to bitcoin in a regulated and transparent exchange-traded vehicle that would act to limit risk‚Äù associated with retail exposure through other means.19 Further, the Exchange asserts that ‚Äúthe manipulation concerns previously articulated by the Commission are sufficiently mitigated to the point that they are outweighed by quantifiable investor protection issues.‚Äù20 What are commenters‚Äô view regarding such an assertion?
4. According to the Exchange, ‚Äú\[n\]early every measurable metric related to \[Chicago Mercantile Exchange‚Äôs\] Bitcoin Futures has trended consistently up since launch and/or accelerated upward in the past year.‚Äù21 Based on data provided and the academic research cited by the Exchange, do commenters agree that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (‚ÄúCME‚Äù) now represents a regulated market of significant size? 22 What are commenters‚Äô views on whether there is a reasonable likelihood that a person attempting to manipulate the Shares would also have to trade on CME to manipulate the Shares? What of the Exchange‚Äôs assertion that the combination of (a) CME bitcoin futures leading price discovery; (b) the overall size of the bitcoin market; and (c) the ability for market participants to buy or sell large amounts of bitcoin without significant market impact helps to prevent the Shares from becoming the predominant force on pricing in either the bitcoin spot or CME bitcoin futures markets?
5. What are commenters‚Äô views on the Exchange‚Äôs statement, generally, that bitcoin is resistant to price manipulation and that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices exist to justify dispensing with the requisite surveillance sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size related to bitcoin?24 What of the Exchange‚Äôs assertion in support of such statement that significant liquidity in the spot market and the decreasing impact of market orders on the overall price of bitcoin mean that attempting to move the price of bitcoin is costly? 25 What of the assertion that offering only in-kind creations and redemptions provides unique protections against potential attempts to manipulate the Shares and that the price the Sponsor uses to value the Trust‚Äôs bitcoin ‚Äúis not particularly important‚Äù?

Bitcoin,Remake Bitcoin's start to date performance,"Would it even be possible to take down the king of the king ? I'm not sure about it but what I'm sure about is that everyone would dream to find another crypto that would do the same performance in the futur.

Because everyone dream to be rich one day, and Bitcoin made everyone believing in it.

If that crypto could really exist wich extraordinary fundamentals would it possibly have ?

Firstly it has to be a store of value to make it comparable to Bitcoin. I'm not comparing bitcoin to Ethereum or others defi crypto/blockchain. Because I really believe that Bitcoin is more to compare as a store of value, where ETH is a decentralise system. 

When I think to a ""store of value"" I think to a limited in number crypto to make it a valuable crypto.
Secondly if we follow the initial purpose of Bitcoin creation, it has to be an easy usable crypto by everyone in the world. 

To make it possible it would logicaly need to be : scalable, secure, fast, feeless and ecological.

No need to explain why it has to be secure, but why feeless ?
Because if we want BIG BIG performance we need this crypto to be adopted by a really large amount of people. And to make it use by everyone in the world this crypto has to be 100% free for every transactions. 
Why ? Because paying 0.1/0.5/1/2/3/10/20 etc. dollars each times we buy something isn't imaginable because it would be a real problem for every little payments and poor people adoption. Imagin if your bank would tax you 1$ for each payments you do ? It's simply impossible to afford.

Why ecological ? Because if all the umanity use this crypto as an everyday payment, it's unthinkable to believe that each futur transactions would cost an anormous amount of energy, growing even more each time the bigger people's adoption it become.

Why scalable ? Simply for making it usable as a very, very large amount of people.

Why fast ? It's simply logical to understand that we need an instant payment for everyday purchases, like with our credit card.

If we realise this, maybe one day this crypto would change the world and potentialy replace Bitcoin...

And if I tell you that only 1 crypto in the world has this fundamentals, and is existing with a 0.5B market cap while BTC is at 500B market cap ?

* Purchasers receive the cryptocurrency amount from an item at the time the customer confirms its delivery instead of waiting for the entire order to be delivered.
* Customers can set a **minimum exchange rate** on the request **to be safe against market rate drops** while it is still waiting to be accepted.

Lets say i have ledger nano s holding btc eth and 2 other alts that work on their platform but they are all stored with same ledger, same wallet with same seed words. How does the seed words coordinate with btc blockchain, eth blockchain and the 2 altcoin blockchains. Like i know each word in the seed words is a number so all 26 words create a giant code number so that code number identifies your share on the btc blockchain, and that same number identifies your share on the eth blockchain and so forth? Is that how it works?

Another follow up question is if i have a wallet lets say nano s, i use it and then drain it empty so theres no crypto on it. Then i close the wallet reset the ledger, and throw away old seed words. What happens to that wallet it no longer identifies anything and is shut down and lost forever? Like those seed words can never be generated again to identifies one owned portion of crypto on a blockchain?

Everything points it could be a death by suicide, the department said in a statement.

The high court had agreed to extradite him back to the U.S. where he faces tax evasion charges.

(When he first came across Bitcoin) I thought it was very smart. But a lot of good ideas just vanish. Bitcoin just keeps growing and growing, not only in price.

Measuring Bitcoin against dollars kind of defeats the point of Bitcoin. 1 BTC = 1 BTC

At the beginning, I thought Bitcoin was beautiful and now I'm even more convinced about it since it has withstood the pressure of time and changes in global political landscapes, social media exploding... you have all these changes but Bitcoin has not only persisted but its impact keeps growing.

It is not just a very good idea anymore. At the beginning it was interesting. Now it's a reality.

Of course, classical economists don't like it. It's not that they don't understand but they don't want to understand it. It would mean all of their preconceptions, their theses, their works, their books would be meaningless because they were wrong.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin is undergoing the largest drop in hashrate in the history of the network.,"The difficulty adjustment for the next epoch is currently sitting at **-24.5%**. This would be the largest reduction in hashrate in the history of Bitcoin network, and has the following implications:

&amp;#x200B;

* Transactions are currently more expensive/slower to confirm than usual.
* Other miners online will be proportionately more profitable, however the dip in price may offset this if they choose sell immediately [(although miners seem to be currently accumulating, signalling that they are profitable and are bullish on future price)](https://twitter.com/glassnodealerts/status/1405093573549232130)
* The price of bitcoin could be impacted in the short term, as there are [some who believe that hashrate is a leading indicator of price.](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/does-hash-rate-follow-price-or-does-price-follow-hash-rate)

Regardless of this, the network currently seems to be chugging along just fine, reinforcing the fact that Bitcoin doesn't really give a shit about government crackdowns, even if the nation in question is the one with the most amount of miners. üöÄ",1624474801,HaveFunStayingRich,True,1,5,2021-06-24

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin's Hashrate Drops Below 100 Exahash, Observers Describe China's 'Great ASIC Exodus'","Most of the crypto community has been focused on the developments in China and more specifically, the crackdowns against bitcoin miners in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Yunnan, and Sichuan. On Wednesday morning (EST), Bitcoin‚Äôs overall hashrate has continued to drop and is now below the 100 exahash per second (EH/s) region. During the last 24 hours, people acquainted with Chinese miners have been describing the latest hardships bitcoin miners are facing.
Hashrate Migration Is ‚ÄòDestined to Be a Long Process‚Äô
Notices stemming from government officials in five Chinese provinces noted that bitcoin mining operations must cease immediately and this has caused a lot of anxiety among some bitcoiners in recent times. On Tuesday, June 22, Bitcoin.com News reported on the hashrate shifts and how mystery hashrate and stealth mining has started to increase following the crackdowns. Bitcoin.com News also explained last week how it is extremely difficult to pinpoint the exact quantity of hashrate that resides in mainland China.
The community can see that the hashrate is now below 100 EH/s and has lost between 15-25% since the Sichuan crackdown. Meanwhile, residents of the western hemisphere have been in the dark in regard to how much hashrate is actually in China, and where mining operations are relocating. However, the regional reporters at 8btc have described some of the events taking place in China, alongside Foundry Digital‚Äôs executive Kevin Zhang.
‚ÄúChinese miners are not familiar with the overseas environment, and moving overseas is destined to be a long process,‚Äù 8btc disclosed on Tuesday in a Twitter thread. 8btc‚Äôs thread stems from translated commentary from a miner dealing with the crackdown situation. ‚ÄúToday, a mining industry insider posted that Chinese miners actually tried to ‚Äòmove overseas‚Äô a few years ago, but it turned out that the overall domestic cost is still the lowest,‚Äù 8btc continued.
‚ÄúSpecifically, bare electricity in Canada and the U.S. is mostly at 0.3 cents, but construction + labor + operation and maintenance + taxation, and various environmental protection standards, have long cycles and high costs,‚Äù the regional report translated by 8btc details. ‚ÄúElectricity prices are cheap in the Far East, but miners are worried about the instability of the local situation. Georgia and Kazakhstan have electricity, but the process is sometimes the same as Vietnam and India.‚Äù
The translated account from China further says that the temperatures in Malaysia and Thailand are too high. Moreover in Africa and Iran, Chinese miners have seen advertisements to set up shop there, but no one knows ‚Äúwho actually went there.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt the same time, Fenghua International Express disclosed that it had airlifted a batch of bitcoin miners to Maryland, USA,‚Äù the thread further added. ‚ÄúIt is reported that this is only the ‚Äòvanguard‚Äô in the army of bitcoin miners that China has shut down, accounting for a very low proportion.‚Äù

8btc‚Äôs thread concluded by stressing: ‚ÄúLuckily, we now have passionate people like [Arman Batayev] from Astana Financial Innovation Centre and [Guy Deriq] from Uganda [who] can help Chinese miners move abroad. Would love to see more people like this coming out.‚Äù",1624473498,fantechhkcFrequent,True,1,3,2021-06-24

""Bigger GDP causes less unemployment resulting in more demand for goods resulting in increasing prices""

""Because prices increase, companies then need to raise wages and pass the increase to consumers through higher prices""

""Explosive GDP growth can cause hyperinflation which causes people to spend even more because they know their money will be worth less in the future""

**""This causes further GDP** and price increase**""**

Bitcoin,While Bitcoin Hits New Lows Gold Bug Peter Schiff Blasts the Top Crypto and Supporters,"The American economist, financial commentator, and gold bug Peter Schiff had a lot to say about bitcoin‚Äôs price sliding on Tuesday. Schiff has always claimed bitcoin‚Äôs value will one day drop to nothing. This week he insists bitcoin‚Äôs chart shows a head and shoulders top pattern with a ‚Äúneckline around $30K the pattern measures a move to zero.‚Äù

## Schiff Believes Microstrategy Will Sell Every Last Satoshi

After bitcoin (BTC) dropped 10% Monday during the overnight and into the morning sessions on Tuesday, Peter Schiff took to his soapbox on Twitter and hammered the leading crypto asset. Schiff often has nothing good to say about bitcoin but on Tuesday, a great majority of his tweets (close to ten in total) were dedicated to bitcoin. The financial commentator talked about his favourite investment, gold, as well, and discussed how the precious metal dipped 6% last week.

‚ÄúOver the weekend bitcoin bugs made fun of gold‚Äôs 6% drop last week, which was about twice bitcoin‚Äôs 3% decline,‚Äù Schiff said. ‚ÄúBut while gold recovered some of those losses today, bitcoin crashed by another 9%. Also, while gold is down 9% from its 2021 high, bitcoin is down a whopping 50%,‚Äù he added.

Schiff‚Äôs tweets even targeted bitcoin bulls like Microstrategy‚Äôs Michael Saylor and Digital Currency Group‚Äôs Barry Silbert. Schiff tweeted:

 One individual defended Microstrategy‚Äôs CEO and told Schiff to debate Saylor or stop criticizing a ‚Äútechnology that you don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù Others stated in the Twitter thread that Schiff has already offered to debate Saylor, but the Microstrategy executive allegedly ‚Äúhas not taken him up on it.‚Äù 

Schiff Slams Silbert and Novogratz, Spencer Schiff Defends Bitcoin

In another tweet on Tuesday, Schiff went after Digital Currency Group‚Äôs CEO Barry Silbert. ‚ÄúIn Mar. \[Barry Silbert\] promised GBTC investors he‚Äôd close the 10% discount to NAV by buying back $250 million of shares,‚Äù Schiff wrote. ‚ÄúAnd then in early May, he promised to increase the buy to $750 million. So far he‚Äôs purchased less than a third of that amount. What are you waiting for Barry?‚Äù Schiff asked the Digital Currency Group executive.

Then the gold bug went after billionaire investor and Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz.

‚ÄúAs bitcoin crashed below $30K, CNBC invited \[Mike Novogratz\] to try to pump it back up,‚Äù Schiff remarked after his many anti-bitcoin tweet bombs on Tuesday. ‚ÄúNovogratz claims Bitcoin can‚Äôt keep falling as there is all this new institutional demand. Assuming some institutions were getting interested above $60K, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve lost interest below $30K.‚Äù

Of course, Schiff‚Äôs son Spencer Schiff got in on the action after his father tweeted about bitcoin doing a dead cat bounce.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get excited about bitcoin‚Äôs dead cat bounce from an intra-day low of around $28.6K to near $32K,‚Äù Schiff‚Äôs tweet scathed on Tuesday. ‚ÄúNothing drops in a straight line, \[especially\] a token as highly manipulated as bitcoin. As this bear market grinds on, about 55% so far, better to sell the rips than buy the dips,‚Äù the economist added. Spencer, however, snarkily snapped back at his father and said:

However, in terms of likes and retweet ratio, Spencer‚Äôs father had more likes and retweets. Others defended Spencer Schiff‚Äôs statement and said that Peter has been ‚Äúspectacularly wrong about Bitcoin multiple times over a decade. If he‚Äôs right this time it will be purely a broken clock situation.‚Äù

## Schiff‚Äôs Bitcoin TA and the Head and Shoulders Patterns That Lead to Zero

Besides the dead cat bounce commentary, Schiff also described an alleged head and shoulders pattern in the BTC/USD chart. As usual, Schiff declared that the leading crypto asset‚Äôs fiat value was on its way to zero.

‚ÄúThe most ominous thing about bitcoin‚Äôs head and shoulders top pattern is that with ahead near $65K and a neckline around $30K the pattern measures a move to zero,‚Äù Schiff wrote. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because the pattern projects a move below the next line that equals the move from the neckline to the head.‚Äù

‚ÄúFunny how you‚Äôll apply low probability TA (technical analysis) to BTC, but you won‚Äôt even consider the annualized returns of bitcoin over the last 10 years,‚Äù an individual responded to Schiff‚Äôs head and shoulders tweet.

Bitcoin,Fungibility. Let's bring it up again! Where are we at now? Let's not ignore the biggest threat to BTC.,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

It's great to see the sub reddit cheering while the price is going up and governments around the world are talking about it openly.

However, the biggest threat to Bitcoin dominance and, unfortunately, it's survival, is it's **fungibility**.

As much as we hate to admit it, current state of affairs points at the fact that **1 BTC != 1 BTC**.

As much as we want BTC to succeed as a currency, we also need to acknowledge that things are pretty sad at the moment. 

FBI tracking coins and marking them (therefore tainted coins), chain analysis companies tracking your previous and! future transactions making sure that none of the coins come from the mixers or go to the mixers (coinjoin is a red flag for the majority of the CEX), same with p2p platforms which are at times the only place where people  from the countries with authoritarian regimes can buy their coins!

Environmental debate sparked a speculation about marking BTC as clean or not clean. And as much as I don't want to admit it, the reality proves that BTC can and does get tracked and rejected.

Ask yourself: would you want to accept BTC as a payment knowing that at any given moment your account may get blocked by CEX? I know, we can use DEX, but for a lot of people ramping off is a necessity. 

We've all become blind to this MAJOR issue, blinded by the ever increasing denomination in fiat currency. It's no surprise governments love blockchain with the open ledger since it actually gives them a wonderful tool to track and intercept any sort of shady activity (which in some countries means being in the opposition to the ruling class).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, there are services like Wasabi and Samurai and Bisq that allow to obfuscate the transactions, but as you can see, coins become simultaneously anonymized and **surveyed** at the same time.

I think we should pin this matter as it is of the highest priority for the entire community. We haven't even noticed how what we fight for has been morphed into a major surveillance system.

&amp;#x200B;

Additional reading that points out the known and proved instances of the matter:

Personally, it feels odd. Why would a company share their own processing capacity with someone else instead of just doing it by itself?

Does it all self funded all donated ? 

Does the founder of site mainly control or others involve as admins / members ?

I got contact with a mate who has a lots of specific domains based on narrative of ones coin and he want me to sell it.

Bitcoin,I love bitcoin. Does it mean it should stay absolutely the same?,"Let's have a respectful discussion about what can be improved about Bitcoin.  
I see a lot of people being way too rigid about admitting that Bitcoin isn't perfect.  


As /u/[**BrownBear521**](https://www.reddit.com/user/BrownBear521/) said in another thread, companies hoarding Bitcoin could potentially be a problem. Hoarding is a big problem when it comes to deflationary currencies. It can create a vicious circle called a deflationary spiral: Here we have a deflationary currency (Bitcoin) so people hoard it in order to get rich. They keep it for themselves without spending it, resulting in a lack of Bitcoin available in the market, which makes the price go higher faster. So people hoard it more and more. It makes Bitcoin a very good investment, for sure, but it doesn't make it a good currency for the economy, as it disadvantages the merchant and advantages the hoarder. Doesn't sound very anticapitalist to me.  
Unpopular opinion: We should find a way to redistribute the Bitcoin.  
A former trader named Anice Lajnef suggests a fork to create a melting currency out of the Bitcoin, which means there would be a negative rate on your savings. The Bitcoin, for investers, would stay. And the Melting Bitcoin could be adopted for a healthy and more egalitarian economy.

Bitcoin,CSW makes the claim that bitcoin can be seized by the government via 10 chinese nodes??,"I have been watching a couple of videos with CSW and other crypto enthusiasts for the last couple of hours. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OekM65zPbc

Craig has continued to make the claim that bitcoins can be seized by court order of a government pressuring the miners. If the miners of that country obey the court order to not process the transaction from a censored address, could that actually prevent a transaction?

I believe he is claiming this because the majority of miners are in china, and these miners could blacklist a bitcoin address in theory. 

However, if this government attack were successful on that bitcoin address, couldn't all the other miners around the world choose not to connect to the chinese miners? The non-chinese miners could choose to blacklist the chinese miners to avoid censorship in the future, no?

And, couldn't the blacklisted bitcoin address simply sweep those coins to a new address, bypassing the miners, and changing addresses at the same time to avoid being censored?",1624424756,A_solo_tripper,True,1,29,2021-06-23

Bitcoin,Hash power reduction attack,"I've heard that in bitcoin's past there was serious concern about a mining death spiral or some other attack where a massive amount of hash power is removed from the network at once.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but the way I understand it is if there's a large amount of hash power removed from the network it will take a bit longer than ten minutes per block to mine each block. And the difficulty adjustment occurs after a certain number of blocks (which generally about two weeks).

Hypothetically if there were a super massive amount of hash power directed at the Bitcoin network to drive up the difficulty insanely high then just completely destroyed could it take down the Bitcoin network? I think the way I heard it was it could push the difficulty up so high that the legitimate miners would take a year to reach the next difficulty adjustment. I believe the concern was that a nation state would direct a massive amount of hash power at the network then remove it all at once.

Clearly this wasn't an issue during the difficulty adjustment back in May, but just curious what amount of hash power the network would have to lose for this to be a serious concern.

Also, if there's a gradually decreasing hash rate will that mean there would be fewer new coins created per hour because the blocks take longer than ten minutes?

Bitcoin,Bitcoin was snatched up after its plunge! The bulls stage a short-selling market?,"Yesterday, Bitcoin investors once again ushered in a bitter blow. The highest drop of Bitcoin yesterday reached more than 10%, which put the recently fragile investors into an endless plunge again, which is really tragic! Yesterday‚Äôs liquidation figures also reached a new high. The number of liquidation exceeded 200,000, which is a high record in the near future!

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday‚Äôs sudden drop was triggered by the news. Yesterday morning, Bitcoin maintained an upward trend. However, due to the impact of sudden bad news in the afternoon, Bitcoin began to plunge sharply, and investors did not respond at all. Coming over, all followed the dive of Bitcoin and there was a stampede sell-off, which led to the crazy dive of Bitcoin!

&amp;#x200B;

It was not until the close of the evening that Bitcoin began to rebound, from a drop of more than 10% to about 4%. However, the mysterious capital of Bitcoin entered the market last night, which led to a rapid increase of 6% in a short period of time! It is worth noting that the CEO of Grayscale posted yesterday that when investors were crying and selling, they were buying. Perhaps this was an important reason for Bitcoin's strong rebound last night!

&amp;#x200B;

The recent trend of Ethereum can be described as horrible. The big brother of Bitcoin has fallen, and Ethereum has fallen following the footsteps of Bitcoin! Yesterday, when Bitcoin fell by 10%, Ethereum had fallen by more than 11%. The recent weak performance of Ethereum has nothing to do with the market trend of the entire cryptocurrency. Therefore, the weak decline of Ethereum is still reasonable, because there is no snowflake in the blood crash. Innocent! However, the current investors in Ethereum may suffer painful lessons. At present, there is still no sign of stopping the decline in the medium and long term of Ethereum, so investors should pay attention to short-term risks in life!

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding the market outlook, ken believes that the current Bitcoin and Ethereum have reached the bottom from a technical analysis. Judging from today‚Äôs rebound, the bulls have a lot of ideas to create a short-selling market, but for the moment, the medium and long-term Bitcoin and Ethereum It is still in a downward trend, so the market like this kind of plunge will happen occasionally, coupled with the impact of recent negative news, so the sharp fluctuation of Bitcoin at the current point is also within a reasonable and reasonable explanation!

&amp;#x200B;

Ken believes that current investors should reasonably control their positions. Because the policy is not clear, it may lead to the risk of unrecoverable investment costs. This is a huge uncertainty, so the current Ken is still relatively cautious!",1624413052,Long_Chard9727,True,1,1,2021-06-23

The year is 2071. Earth's population is 20 billion. Bitcoin is the standard, topping out its price at 10 million USD apiece. Stargates were just invented to allow fast travel to other planets hundreds if not thousands of light-years away in just seconds.              

2072 rolls along. Half of Earth's population leaves so they can make a living on new planets. But they leave Bitcoin on earth because of the impossibilities of keeping the entire blockchain in sync over thousands if not millions of light-years and several planets is impossible.            

Half of earth's population leaves and sells their bitcoin when they do leave. That takes us from 20 billion people to 10 billion people. This means double the bitcoin for each person left on Earth. **Bitcoin's price value then goes from 10 million USD apiece to 5 million apiece due to the drastic drop in demand - this means that price dynamically adjusts with demand as necessary.**",1624410970,sgtslaughterTV,True,1,21,2021-06-23

Ever since, it has been trading at a discount and has never turned positive despite a massive crash in the underlying asset.

&amp;#x200B;

As we know, over the last few months there have been an explosion of new stock tickers tradfi uses to get ""exposure"" to bitcoin. Square, Overstock, Microstrategy, ARK ETF, Tesla, Coinbase, the many miner stocks, and now 3 Canadian ETFs.

Bitcoin,A message to all,"One decade and two years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new currency, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all coins are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that coin, or any coin so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure in this world. We are met on a great battle-field of that market. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their tendies that that coin might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, rich and broke, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the hodlers, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored hodlers we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of their savings -- that we here highly resolve that these hodlers shall not have bought in vain -- that this coin, under Nakamoto, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the blockchain, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

Bitcoin,How to keep your Bitcoin safe ?,"**Bought crypto at a great dip. Now what ? How do you keep your coins safe ?**

Now that the markets are dipping, I felt this would be a good time to post about how to keep our crypto safe as we expect the veterans to pull in their friends and family into the crypto markets. This will help all the newbies navigate the security measures in cryptoverse.

&amp;#x200B;

* **ENABLE 2FA Authenticator everywhere. Use a separate email for crypto. Use google authenticator instead of SMS authenticator. NO QUESTIONS ASKED.**
* **You take it off the exchange. You do not leave your coins on the exchange.  "" NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS.""** The only times I leave coins on the exchange is when I know that I am looking to buy more coins in the next several hours. That way I avoid paying fees multiple times to withdraw from the wallet. But with coins like ADA , SOL, ONE where the fees is so low that it might even be worth getting the coins off the exchange even if you do intend to buy more coins in the next 12-24 hours.  **Alternatively, if you bought BTC or ETH/ERC-20 tokens,** you could possibly wait till your done accumulating for the session and then pay the fee at once to pull your coins out. Sure you have to pay the transaction fees but hey, that's the cost of doing business here.
*  ALWAYS do regular scans on your main computer which you use to buy/store your coins for malware and other threats. 
*  Never publicly reveal your holdings. Never trust anyone who reveals their holdings publicly either. They are either malicious or they are lying or they are just stupid. You do not need to associate with such people in any case.
*  Never use the email you use for your social accounts as your exchange's email. If you have made that mistake already, consider changing the mail or alternatively changing the account. Yes, it may sound extreme but it is worth it.
*  Do not visit shady websites from your main computer. Sure, you may have anti-virus but do not risk it. Especially avoid visiting illegal websites that stream shows, sports events and porn.
*  Do invest in a hardware wallet as soon as you feel it is worth it. BUT MAKE SURE that you buy directly from the manufacturer's website or from a very reputable retailer.
*  I would always suggest choosing wallets which have multiple assets storage over  storing your assets in separate chrome extension wallets. Particular example comes to mind with EXODUS vs YOROI when staking ADA. It might be an unpopular opinion but for those who do not own BOATLOADS of ADA, in my opinion, I feel it is better to use EXODUS even though you get 0.8% less APY. You can store multiple assets on the wallet. Just making the entire process easier. And incase you do own BOATLOADS of ADA, you should be using Daedalus wallet anyways. Just my opinion. Take it with a grain of salt.
*  FACT CHECK EVERYTHING. I have lost quite a bit (not crypto but in general) by not questioning people because I was afraid I would offend them. If they are correct, they will always be delighted to prove their point. 
* DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING. Double check whether you pasted the correct wallet address. Double check the authenticator code. Double check whether the girl you like is only into you for your crypto. Double-checking never hurts.
