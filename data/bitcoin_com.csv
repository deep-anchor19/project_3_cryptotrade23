I mean, look at obedient blob Angela Merkel, do you really think she got elected due to charm or talent?

What about the current US president, the dude has dementia ffs.  You think more people came out for him on election day  than any candidate ever, in the history of America? (when he cant even draw a crowd of 100 people when he appears somewhere in person).

You think intellectual lightweight, pretty boy Trudeau won on his own merits? or stays in power based on his machiavellian political acumen?

Of course not. 

Not to say all elections are fake, but those who best appease the globalists/elites get to stay in power, and those who try to expose the truth, or shine a light on the deep state will have the full weight of the globalist system unleashed upon them.

Bitcoin,"&gt;This may be incorrect 

It is.

&gt; this is an easy way to track what your actually fiat gains are vs. what you actually spent

I don't know what you're trying to say here, but it's not how capital gains are calculated. 


&gt;I spend $4,000 to buy 4 BTC. Cost basis = $4,000 out of pocket

Cost basis is $1000 per BTC.

&gt;I sell 1 BTC for $2,000. 

Capital gain on sale of 1 BTC is (proceeds from sale of 1 BTC - cost of that 1 BTC - transaction costs). For your example, $2000 - $1000 = $1000 cap gain ... taxed.

&gt; I have 3 BTC left. $4,000 - $2,000 = I'm still down $2,000 out of pocket

Sure, but ""I'm still down in my overall holdings/portfolio"" is not how cap gains are calculated.

&gt;I sell 1 BTC for $2,000. 

Again, $2000 - $1000 = $1000 cap gain ... taxed.

&gt; I have 2 BTC left. $2,000 - $2,000 = I'm at break even with cost of $0 out of pocket

Good for you, but you still owe taxes on the $2000 you gained from selling 2 BTC for a profit of $1000 each.

&gt;I sell 1 BTC for $1,000. $1,000 - $0 = $1,000 profit so I pay taxes on this gain.

No. $1000 proceeds - $1000 cost = $0 cap gain on this sale.

&gt;I still HODL 1 BTC and I never sell. I never pay any taxes on it.

No. The cost basis of that 1 BTC was $1000 when you acquired it and will remain $1000 for as long as you hold it. If you sell it for more than $1000, that's a capital gain and unless you're in a country that doesn't tax capital gains on crypto, you'll owe taxes on your profit.",1626979831,2021-07-23

https://bluewallet.io - easy to use, Open Source, Non-custodial (although I believe LN is custodial if not using own node)

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix works on Android or iOS

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - Android or iOS

https://muun.com - Muun - another non custodial LN wallet working on Android and iOS

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words safe.

I literally just explained to you how they add up and you come back with effectively ""nuh uh!""

Uh ok then. Cool story

&gt; So it would be natural to have failing (bankruptcies) from those loan companies

Companies do well on their loans far more often than they do poorly. The ones that would do badly are weeded out with background data and interviews, etc. Sure bankruptcies DO happen if they make a huge string of stupid decisions in a row, sure, but don't USUALLY happen nor make the business model non viable.

Also, bailouts would still be entirely possible, they'd simply have to be paid for with taxes instead of printing. So they would be less common, but would still happen now and then.

So there isn‚Äôt much of a difference between using Bitcoin vs USD. just ask your parents or most teenagers. They really could not care less. 

Sure there is a valid point of protection from inflation. But you have to understand that for the general population, they don‚Äôt really care much about it because they simply don‚Äôt have enough money for inflation to actually matter. Not only that, USD won‚Äôt lose its value overtime as rapidly as some other currencies. They export oil and to buy oil, they force other countries to convert their currency into USD first - thereby shielding from rapid inflation. 

Now the biggest problem with Bitcoin becoming the enormous currency like a lot of people hope to be, is the fact that the governments will simply ban them. They can and they will if their OWN currency is threatened due to Bitcoin. Sure some politicians and big whales have money into Bitcoin but not as much as they have in the stock market.

Bitcoin,"&gt; People call Elon dumb, stupid, an idiot, etc. because they don't agree with his view on Bitcoin and crypto and stuff. But I would want to see them try and come up with things like PayPal, Tesla, and SpaceX.

I think Elon is a smart guy, but even smart people can be wrong or uninformed (evidenced by his statements on big blocks and running nodes, and his ridiculous statements about certain altcoin block times and exchanges acting as a ""second layer""). In the case of bitcoin, he's clearly ignorant of a lot of its history, even some things very recent, which is frustrating to those of us who have been intimately involved for many years. One of the problems with ego is that it can make it difficult to accept new, contradictory information. There's a reason ""stay humble and stack sats"" is a popular saying in this community... I think there should be a lot more emphasis on the ""stay humble"" part than there is, especially in his case.

&gt;Yeah, he's not the actual engineer behind the work, but the dude is plenty smart enough to understand the general science and coding done behind everything

The problem (imo) is that *Elon has positioned himself* as the expert, the founder, the head engineer. He isn't really those things, but he's good at cultivating that image. He even calls himself the founder of Tesla when he is not (he bought it from the two founders). There's a massive amount of ego in Musk, and it's not incorrect or envy when it's pointed out.

&gt;clearly smart enough to become a billionaire by building a team of people who know more than him and can push his companies further

Don't you think coming from money is a massive head start? Let's dispel this myth of the self-made man... it's not true in almost every case of well known billionaires (Bezos, Gates, Musk, and others), as many of them received either money directly from their parents, connections via those parents, or a leg up at the very start in a way that most people could only dream of. 

I think EM has some great goals. I own a Tesla and it's my favorite car I've ever owned... can't wait for my Cybertruck. I hope to ride to Mars on a SpaceX rocket someday. If he accomplishes his goals of making EVs commonplace and making humanity a multi-planetary species, I think it will make up for his other faults... but that doesn't erase his faults, or make them out of bounds for discussion.

* Do not trust unsolicited messages telling you to check out some shady website.
* Do not trust Discord randos telling you that you won a prize.
* Do not trust anyone who promises guaranteed profits.
* Do not trust website with unpronounceable domain names
* Do not trust anyone claiming to give away free Bitcoin. (YouTube, Twitter, Discord)
* Do not trust anyone claiming they will double however much Bitcoin you send them.
* Do not trust 'pretty girls' on Tinder telling you about new investment opportunities.
* **If you have to ask** if some sketchy website or special offer is a scam, **then it probably is.**

You have to learn to think for yourselves. Recognize that there are many tricksters out there who will go to great lengths to separate you from your Bitcoin. Use your head and stay safe. If you send your Bitcoin to a scammer, it's gone forever. There are no refunds!

Also, I'm pretty sure one of the major limiting factors of satellite lifespan is the energy source, so using any of that extremely limited and precious energy to mine Bitcoin would be kind of insane.

It basically shows current temperatures and CO2 levels compared to those of previous interglacial warm periods, and shows that our current temperatures are below those normally seen in interglacial periods.  The time scale here covers hundreds of thousands of years.  

The second is an ftp link to temperature data from NOAA.  If you download and plot the data, it shows that the 1930s and 40s were hotter than today.  The vast majority of high temperature records occurred in 1936.  Read The Grapes of Wrath to see this documented in popular culture, including sharecroppers fleeing the Midwest and heading to California.  NOAA then 'adjusts' the data to cool the 1930s and 40s before they release graphs to the public.  The data is deliberately tampered with.  

I do not trust any government funded study after 1999.  Something changed after that, science became driven by politics.  Since the federal government is funding climate science, they are going to get the results they want.  Guidance is given when awarding research contracts  That is, those funding the science are going to get the results they want.

And here is the source that you asked for.  Temperatures in the US are colder today than they were in the 1940s.  But you are correct that the Earth is warmer overall today compared to the 1940s.  However, this study begins in 1880, during the lowest part of a small ice age.  Global temps are still lower today than they were in 1000 AD.  Page 37 figure 6:

Bitcoin,"I'd just add that it is very important for people to remember that LN is an arrow in your quiver. Depending on the size and type of transaction you are making, the incentives for cheating are different. The blockchain and lightning network are designed to handle this differently.

The Blockchain has a LOT of uses, but relative to this conversation are two key attributes:

1. Consulting the public ledger (the block chain) tells me whether or not the person offering bitcoin actually has it to spend (i.e. it prevents double spending).
2. Waiting for one or more blocks to be mined tells me that the overall network has consensus that the transaction was valid (i.e. it prevents ""reversing"" the transaction).

When we buy and sell houses (REAL BIG TRANSACTIONS), the stakes of fraud (i.e. the potential cost or payout from cheating) are very high. Therefore you search for liens against the property, and do a title search to ensure that the seller really has ownership, and maybe even buy insurance in case that title search was wrong. You also use an escrow service to prevent ""reversing"" the transactions. We spend money and time up front to decrease the likelihood of cheating.

But with smaller transactions, like buying soda from a hotel vending machine, the stakes of fraud are much smaller. It isn't worth your time to review service logs or get inventory audits to give assurances that your $1 will produce a Coke. In general, because the stakes are so low, we trust that if there is some problem, it can be handled after the fact, like by complaining to the hotel owner. Overall, when the stakes of a transaction are low, then the risk of fraud is low, and we can trust that post facto resolution is acceptable.

The Blockchain, as a public ledger, is very important for BIG transactions. And that comes with a cost in Time (waiting on verification) and Money (mining fees). When the stakes are high, you pay that cost. The Lightning network prevents double spending by forcing both parties to stake their money on the blockchain (essentially pre-aggregating a bunch of transactions into a large enough stake to justify the fees), but it handles ""reversing transactions"" post facto- if one party in the channel asserts that they actually have $20 more, and the other party can show the opposite, then the fraudulent chap is punished. When the stakes are so low (cost and payout of fraud), this post facto resolution works just fine. And it brings extra benefits in the form of speed and privacy.",1626968230,2021-07-22

Bitcoin,"&gt; Does this somehow still helps the network? Is my contribution to the network meaningfull?  

Not really. A full node's primary purpose is to help **you**, the node maintainer, to trustlessly check your bitcoin balances and to retain a higher level of privacy on the network. Other nodes don't trust your node in the first place, so it doesn't really benefit the network to have another node in there.  

You don't need any balance on your node btw, you can simply connect your hardware wallet to it, then it becomes useful to you. And then the network benefits directly from another sovereign peer :)

&gt; If you don't use your node for personal transactions, it has effectively no impact on the network.

Bitcoin,"&gt; what does that big number tell me precisely? Is it a measurement of time? Number of guesses for solving the Nonce-puzzle?  
&gt; ""It describes how hard it is to mine a block"" is just not precisely enough..

Internally, Bitcoin doesn't use ""difficulty"". It uses ""target"". The target hash is stored in every block header and recalculated using a time ratio calculation every 2016 blocks  
https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch10.asciidoc  

    New Target = Old Target * (Actual Time of Last 2016 Blocks / 20160 minutes)

SHA-2 hashing produces a random distribution of results. Bitcoin mining requires a hash within a range - from zero to the current target. The size of the range (relative to the size of the total SHA256 domain) is the probability of finding a hash within the range. This is why the retargeting calculation uses a simple linear time ratio  

The target is like golf, smaller is harder  

Difficulty is an arbitrary number which is inversely proportional to target, for people who want harder to mean bigger (golf haters). The calculation is derived from Satoshi's original choice of target, and his decision to refer to that target value as `difficulty = 1`  

The formula is in the Bitcoin Wiki  
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty  

    difficulty = difficulty_1_target / current_target

Fun fact: for most of 2009, there was not enough mining hash power to create blocks in 10 minutes with the `difficulty=1` target.

Bitcoin,"&gt; JPMorgan gave its financial advisors the green light to give all its wealth-management clients access to cryptocurrency funds, making it the first major US bank to do so, Insider has learned.
&gt; 
&gt; The bank, which has been making a significant push to grow its $630 billion wealth-management business, told advisors in a memo earlier this week that they can now take orders to buy and sell five cryptocurrency products, four from Grayscale Investments and one from Osprey Funds, effective July 19.
&gt; 
&gt; A person directly familiar with the move said it applies to all JPMorgan clients seeking investment advice, including its bank's self-directed clients using its commission-free Chase trading app, mass affluent clients whose assets are managed by financial advisors under JPMorgan Advisors, and ultrarich clients serviced by the private bank.
&gt; 
&gt; JPMorgan's advisors can execute only ""unsolicited"" crypto trades, meaning advisors cannot recommend the products but are allowed to buy or sell on the behalf of a client's request. The funds JPMorgan has approved include Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust, Bitcoin Cash Trust, Ethereum Trust, and Ethereum Classic vehicles, as well as Osprey Funds' Bitcoin Trust, the person said.
&gt; 
&gt; In April JPMorgan said it was preparing to offer an actively managed bitcoin fund to private wealth clients to be rolled out this summer, CoinDesk first reported.
&gt; 
&gt; The move marks a milestone in the bank's digital asset offerings, after its CEO, Jamie Dimon, threatened in 2017 to fire employees who traded bitcoin. While Dimon has since softened his sentiment toward crypto, he said in May that he was still not a supporter of the asset class despite growing client interest in it.
&gt; 
&gt; JPMorgan's asset and wealth-management chief, Mary Callahan Erdoes, told Bloomberg that many of the bank's clients view crypto as an asset class and want to invest in it.
&gt; 
&gt; Rival banks such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America have not given retail wealth clients direct access to crypto products. Morgan Stanley was the first big bank to begin offering wealthy clients ‚Äî those with at least $2 million in invested assets ‚Äî access to bitcoin funds, through a partnership with Galaxy Digital in April, CNBC reported.
&gt; 
&gt; Goldman Sachs started offering crypto futures trading to institutional clients and hedge funds last month. It told CNBC in March it was close to offering bitcoin and other digital assets to its wealthiest clients.",1626966987,2021-07-22

https://www.enerdynamics.com/Energy-Currents_Blog/How-Much-Primary-Energy-Is-Wasted-Before-Consumers-See-Value-from-Electricity.aspx

    Ever wonder how much of the primary energy that goes into creating electricity actual provides useful work to us as consumers? Well the answer is not much ‚Äì depending on the device using electricity it‚Äôs anywhere from 30% to as little as 5%. So, where does all that wasted energy go and what can we do about it? Or is it even worth trying? To address these questions, let‚Äôs look at where electricity is lost in the delivery chain.

    Losses in generation, transmission, and distribution First, let‚Äôs consider the primary energy that enters the electric delivery system at the input to the generator and examine how much of the primary energy is delivered to the customer. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the answer is 34%. In other words, 66% of the primary energy used to create electricity is wasted by the time the electricity arrives at the customer meter.

Other sources claim that 17% of all power generated is wasted in the generation and transmission (with or without Bitcoin). Bitcoin uses one twentieth of one percent of all power:: 0.05 vs 17.0 percent.

Bitcoin's energy usage is not a problem - there is a lot of deception being pushed. Congratulations, you've been deceived.

Not any single Bitcoin dev group, not any single miner, not any institution and definitely not Musk. Most of us own a piece of it and have some influence over the direction based on how many people agree with us or listen to each one of us but Bitcoin is not any solo entity's asset. Even Satoshi at this point only has a small proportion of control over Bitcoin. If he came back and dumped his coins (which is the worst thing he could do) after he was done dumping he would have no more control over Bitcoin than any other developer who has worked on it.",1626964998,2021-07-22

At my place in Germany, a house located in a more rural area would cost let‚Äôs say 500.000$ (that would be not even big, just for simplicity).

One Bitcoin is 30.000$ currently, so you would need roughly 17 BTC to buy an average house nowadays.

Now the speculation: I think Bitcoin will further advance its position as digital gold, and therefore approaches the current gold value of ~20 trillion in total. Assuming 2% inflation per year, that would be around 25 trillion in 9 years.

I don‚Äôt think Bitcoin will have reached the same value as gold in 2030, but I would assume like 40-60% of its value, so let‚Äôs just say 15 trillion dollar as Bitcoin market cap in 2030.

That would put the Bitcoin price 30x higher than now to 900.000$ which I personally even find kind of bearish. Let‚Äôs just assume 1 million $, for math reasons.

An average house here for 500k (with 9 years inflation 600k) would be 0.6 Bitcoin in 2030 with this calculation.",1626963934,2021-07-22

Bitcoin,"&gt; Yesterday Elon said that LN has no public ledger. Is that true?

It's kinda true, because a channel's internal transactions are only visible to the two channel's counterparts. LN nodes can also only connect to certain other nodes (like f.ex you can only connect to your friends' nodes and neither you nor them have to connect to anybody else beyond your friend circle, so you have a private LN network, which nobody ""outside"" has any awareness of).  

&gt; Seems like it does make it easier to get away with fraudulent behavior on LN than on-chain  

No, not really. Every LN channel opening transaction is verified on-chain, and any misbehaviour within the channel is prevented/punished by your own node. There are certain attack scenarios that are specific to LN and need to be solved differently than on-chain, but it's not really ""easier"" to cheat per se.",1626959059,2021-07-22

I support him because I like his content and his guests.

He gives a platform to people from all sides and backgrounds. If they are full of shit, he calls them out. Everyone has the right to speak, it‚Äôs called free speech. It‚Äôs the reason you can call him a ‚Äútwat‚Äù and call his viewers ‚Äúretards‚Äù. If he shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to speak, then nor should you based on how you communicate and treat others. But I would never do that, because it‚Äôs important we hear the bad ideas. If someone says something racist, evil or hateful, we should know. It exposes them.

They make a good point - bitcoin, to an outsider, looks very daunting. There's a lot of advice on how to secure your own keys and stuff but it would go way over the head of anyone who's not completely tech literate. 

A lot of people will never buy bitcoin unless it is explained or laid out in a way that they understand. I'm not talking about understanding Blockchain technology or how mining works, but just the stuff you need to know to be able to buy, trade and sell bitcoins. Also simple things like bitcoin addresses look very daunting. 

It's a long string of numbers and letters. Of course we know you can just copy and paste them, but a QR code is a much easier option. It's little things like that that will boost adoption. Putting what we already have into slightly less scary packages. Building a UI in a way that is easy to read and hides the stuff you don't really need to see, like the actual address.

Bitcoin,"&gt;Sometimes its hard to tell the difference between wise people and people who simply say things that fit your world view. Unless you're skeptically critical of the views of these wise people, you can't really be sure you've used anything advantageous.

I agree, however I have found higher odds of success in being prudent about the context of commentary by those I consider wise.  Take Neil Degrass Tyson for a moment.  He is an astrophysicist.  I certainly would put more weight vehind his view of a topic relating to space than I would Joe Rogan.  However, before the pandemic really started, he was asked by Stephen Colbert to tell him about Covid.  Neil did the right thing in that moment.  He didn't hypothesize about it, he explained that it was not his domain of expertise and refused to comment.  He did however state that he thought it would be interesting to see if people listened to medical experts and followed thwir recommendations.  I thought he was mad...who ths hell doesn't listen to their own doctors?  Only an asshold wouldn't follow medical advice, especially during an outbreak of something.  Well...he knew something I didn't about human reactions to pandemics...but he didn't say anything that wasn't totally logically defensible and he kept him his own zone of wisdom.  That...that right there....is what I am talking about.  Sometimes you gotta have some patience and digest what someone tells you.

&gt;
Do I? I don't expect Joe has any particularly insightful view of Bicoin as far as I'm concerned. I know a billion times more about bitcoin than Joe Rogan does. Again, he's an entertaining interviewer that creates insightful interviews by asking the right questions and being just smart enough and just real enough to ask the questions that people care about.

Then we agree.  Him defending Bitcoin is a waste of time to watch.

&gt;
He's good at that. He's open to hearing a lot of different viewpoints but also knows when people are bullshitting. Those are good skills. But they have tradeoffs, and they don't mean his opinion should be randomly trusted about anything he talks about. You shouldn't trust anyone with everything they talk about.

I know.  But again, the moon landing.  Something well established.  And he spent how much time arguing with people over it?  


&gt;
Some people are fine with believing whatever their teachers tell them in school, and whatever the goverenment tells them happens behind closed doors at the CIA, and whatever the TV tells them. And then there's people that actually try to verify the truth for themselves. Joe Rogan's in the latter category. Something tells me you aren't.

I just wanna be clear here.  He doubted the moon landing on bad evidence, wasted tons of time feeding his audience bullshit and then brought a scientist on and argued with him.

Some users are developing a habit of asking if various random websites some complete stranger PM'd them is a scam or not. Sometimes these sites are completely unrelated to Bitcoin. This is not the purpose of r/Bitcoin.

* Do not trust unsolicited messages telling you to check out some shady website.
* Do not trust Discord randos telling you that you won a prize.
* Do not trust anyone who promises guaranteed profits.
* Do not trust website with unpronounceable domain names
* Do not trust anyone claiming to give away free Bitcoin. (YouTube, Twitter, Discord)
* Do not trust anyone claiming they will double however much Bitcoin you send them.
* Do not trust 'pretty girls' on Tinder telling you about new investment opportunities.
* **If you have to ask** if some sketchy website or special offer is a scam, **then it probably is.**

You have to learn to think for yourselves. Recognize that there are many tricksters out there who will go to great lengths to separate you from your Bitcoin. Use your head and stay safe. If you send your Bitcoin to a scammer, it's gone forever. There are no refunds!

Even if a top earner holds some cash and it's a multiple of what average people have, they still earn money through appreciating assets via inflation. Having 100% savings in cash and have your income be 100% cash means you are affected by inflation by 100%. If you only hold 15% cash the negative effect inflation has on you is only 15% but on 85% of your wealth inflation has a positive effect.

From the abstract; Empirical data show that real wages fall sharply during periods of high inflation. This paper suggests a simple general equilibrium explanation, without relying on nominal rigidities. It presents an intertemporal two-sector model with a credit channel of monetary transmission. In this setting, inflation reduces real wages through (1) a decline of the capital stock, and (2) a shift in relative prices. The two effects are additive and make the decline in real wages exceed the decline in per capita GDP. This mechanism may contribute to rising poverty during periods of high inflation.",1626942348,2021-07-22

Actually that's precisely what you said. But whatever, glad we agree now.

&gt; easily forged

Uh no, it's not. You can measure multiple different things about gold to authenticate it quickly and reliably. The easiest is that it has MUCH higher density than anything you could possibly forge it with. Even much higher than lead (which would make it look totally wrong anyway).

So just drop the gold in some water, get the volume, weigh it, divide, and you can be 100% sure if the gold is adulterated. The only things denser than gold weren't available in the ancient world and are even more valuable than gold nowadays anyway.

Gold is **100% trustless** and this method of verification has been known about since the ancient Greeks.

Yet loans were still all over the place.

So your theory is super wrong. The exact same will not happen with bitcoin, as it has for this other **trustless** currency for hundreds of years before.

This is not a theory. This is not an opinion. This is a fact: trustless currency does nothing to stop loans.",1626938612,2021-07-22

Err‚Ä¶So? they have more money, of course in a dollar basis they would lose more from inflation, of what relevance is that to anything? You need to take the aggregate loss/benefit across the entire asset portfolio to determine who is really benefiting or not. As the rich hold the majority of their wealth in assets other than cash, they are sheltered from the effects of inflation despite the face they hold more $ in cash. I.e the performance of the assets they own outweighs the inflation loss in any smaller %ages of cash they own.

Do I? I don't expect Joe has any particularly insightful view of Bicoin as far as I'm concerned. I know a billion times more about bitcoin than Joe Rogan does. Again, he's an entertaining interviewer that creates insightful  interviews by asking the right questions and being just smart enough and just real enough to ask the questions that people care about. He's good at that. He's open to hearing a lot of different viewpoints but also knows when people are bullshitting. Those are good skills. But they have tradeoffs, and they don't mean his opinion should be randomly trusted about anything he talks about. You shouldn't trust *anyone* with everything they talk about. 

&gt; There is being open minded and then there is being so gullibly open minded that your brain falls out of your skull.

Some people are fine with believing whatever their teachers tell them in school, and whatever the goverenment tells them happens behind closed doors at the CIA, and whatever the TV tells them.

Dollar Cost Averaging is an investment strategy where you pick a dollar amount and invest it regardless of price periodically. Say $100 a month. Whether Bitcoin goes up or down you buy $100 a month no matter what. Over the long term you don't stress about volatility because when the price is up you're buying less, when the price is down you're buying more. If the amount your spending each month is small enough that you won't miss it too badly, you won't stress out over the volatility that comes with Bitcoin. Over a period of years, following this strategy could pay off amazingly, without trying to rely on perfectly timing the market, which is basically impossible anyway.",1626928715,2021-07-22

Another way to look at this is: what would happen if security decreases as the value increased? It would make the chain more insecure. There‚Äôs a breakpoint where it suddenly becomes economically viable to attack the chain.

Bitcoin has serious flaws and will make things only worse. If it fails, it fails. But if it succeeds (which it cannot), it will impose a time tax on the young, just like how real estate did to the young. Time tax is the worst form of tax and a destroyer of happiness.",1626924458,2021-07-22

One idea for approximating that MFA would be to use a passphrase (""13th word"" / ""25th word""); and secure that in a password manager or something that requires MFA. You could also put some tiny amount in the unpassphrased wallet to detect seed exposure (""decoy wallet""). This model does introduce some risks though (what happens if your MFA provider goes AWOL?)

Bitcoin,"To get specific - he said one comment that was sort of interesting... either shrink the base chain, or expand it.

This is where a lack of history with BTC comes into play **no one** really wants to expand the base chain, period.

The whole idea is to do 'second layer' transactions, and also **expanding** the base chain is one of the things requiring a hard fork (shrinking it does not).

So by default - expanding the base chain and DOING LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO - are equally impossible with Bitcoin. It is not meant to be done.

It was done purely as a stop-gap measure, while technology improved (and frankly I think Lightning + 'services' 'paypal, robin hood, cash app' - are expanding sufficiently that chain will never be expanded again).

So YES we would LOVE to shrink the BTC block chain! It **won't be necessary**, due to his other comment on how 'dial up' was common when BTC began, and adding 50 GB / yr to the blockchain likely won't prove detrimental... BUT if it were...

""Shrinking"" is better than centralization - AND is the only option afforded Bitcoins, without a hard fork.

---

If I was to be a whack a doodle commenting... I might say BTC could double block sizes every 5 years, maybe.. but it's a mute point. **He addressed this himself**, shrinking **would be** the correct direction. So it's mute...

To put it back to Tesla logic, once you get a car down to 1 part, do you go to 0 parts or 2 parts?.. or do you move on to other issues..

---

Now he did bring up another issue about being 'money transmitters', which is a legal, non-technical, issue.. laws can be written to address this. And it's no different than running a node of a number of other type blockchains, and likewise calling them money transmitters, etc... so.

Anyways, I am glad Musk has more BTC than the other coins. It surprises me!

Overall I took the thing as quite apologetic, yet... apologizing in private, but cutting up in public, does not a mensch make.

So. Ya. He's a one-eye on him, sort of guy..

I'm fine with him 'doing his own thing' but the absurd slams are just... I would call it 'faux salesmanship' if he wasn't apparently losing a lot of money from it too (unless he's buying BTC behind the scenes... which is actually quite possible, then.. good on him).",1626913523,2021-07-22

You are right not everyone does but you can't make sure everyone fact checks things he says and it takes a lot of effort to speak in such a way that you make no mistakes when openly discussing important or sensitive topics. If you don't like him i don't expect you to be persuaded otherwise by me. 

&gt;Other people doing the same thing is not a fair justification for doing something harmful.

It's not that i am justifying what he has said, just that we are all human and on a civilian level we make mistakes in our thought process all the time. I have offended people at work when not meaning to or unwittingly approached a sensitive subject with someone. It doesnt make me an asshole, if i am wrong or i see it clearly bothers somebody then i back off make my justifications for how i feel or just outright apologise. Joe has done these things publicly when experiancing backlash

&gt;With a public platform should come a responsibility to make sure what you put out there on it is either factually correct or presented as an opinion.

I only kind of agree with you here. He isnt a news site and has never marketed his show as one. He can only prepare so much because the conversations tend to lead all over the place and as an entertainer if a conversation is interesting he can't just shut it down and try and find another topic, conversations don't work like that and doing so would alter the atmosphere on his show. I agree it should be presented as opinion and my experiance from Joes shows is that he does speak in a manor that presents as his opinion a lot of the time. I am sure there are plenty of examples to the contrary too, no ones perfect and i have never felt it was for an agenda. 

&gt;In many ways I think Joe Rogan is worse than someone like Tucker Carlson for the very reason that he is often honest, unbiased, and is not trying to push an agenda, at least with someone like Tucker you know what the game is.

Strongly disagree with this. Tucker Carlson is a manipulative ""journalist"". His show is marketed as a news show and he bends and cherry picks facts to his benefit. He is deliberately spreading misinformation. The poor fools that lap up his stories are no better than the poor fools that don't fact check the stuff Joe says.

Bitcoin,"If you're paying your bills / salaries / rent in USD then you're probably best off tracking everything in USD.

Meaning you can accept payments in BTC but you'll just convert it to USD. Similar to if I paid you using my Canadian credit card except in my case the credit card company does the conversion, in your case either you or your payment system provider would do it.

I think today the main reasons to support BTC payments are as a value-add for the consumer and also because it can be cheaper overhead-wise than processing credit card payments. NOT because your business needs BTC.

However, maybe as part of your business plan you plan to keep a certain amount of capital in BTC, as an investment and/or hedge (or as Michael Saylor would say, as your claim to a piece of Digital Manhattan). While you could maintain this completely separately from the conversion process I mentioned, it would make sense to avoid unnecessary conversions and retain some portion of received BTC payments to fill out this part of your balance sheet.

As time goes on though, maybe paying your bills / salaries / rent using BTC instead of USD would become more of a thing. Also, maybe the various collateralized loan products out there would help make dealing with BTC more feasible (similar to how taking out a fiat bank loan may be a good way for a business to deal with cash flow variations)",1626912305,2021-07-22

Bitcoin,"TBH if looked at from a pure business perspective he made an amazing play, the price of BTC was trading around the mid 50ks on May 12th the day Tesla retracted BTC as payment. Any Teslas purchased with Bitcoin before that time period would've meant they bought Tesla's at a 50% discount considering the price of Bitcoin today.

However I don't think Musk is savy enough or big enough to actually move the market in this manner, this seems more like someone knows something and Tesla was warned beforehand.",1626912302,2021-07-22

I.e. Where do we draw the line between dip and recession/plateau? If the longest ""dip"" BTC history lasted 1 year and we're approaching 3 years, when is it time to focus on diversifying into other investment opportunities?

I feel like you might be getting upset, I'm only asking honest questions. If I were to ask you directly, I guess my question would be, ""under what circumstances would you lose faith in BTC and how do you know when those have been met?""",1626911930,2021-07-22

The current equal representation per person for bitcoin is 0.0027272727272727 bitcoin per person....
At todays price that means its current value per person if every single person wanted their ""share"" of bitcoin would be about $96 usd...
The current world ""Gdp"" is $80,934,771,028,340... almost 81 trillion.
If every person on earth today owned their share of bitcoin its value to be $739,200,000,000.... only 739 billion.
With a multiplication value of only 29, this will only bring the price to $21,436,800,000,000.... 21 trillion....
This puts the equal representation per person for bitcoin of 0.0027272727272727 at about $2784. Pretty good return on investment of $96 to secure your ""share"" of bitcoin in todays price.

People don't want to just store value they want to **gain** value. And businesses need fronted capital. So two groups have what each other need and obviously there would be an investment market AKA stock market.

Thinking there would be no stock market with bitcoin makes no sense whatsoever, since the stock market has nothing fundamentally to do with fiat and still operated in full force outside of times when fiat was used.

Of course there would still be stock markets. And banks. And business loans. And mortgages. None of that has any reason to disappear even if bitcoin was 100% the currency used.

To wrap it up, the electricity spent on mining trends towards:

electricity usage in dollars = (block rewards + fees) \* price - capital depreciation discount

Capital depreciation discount is quite high right now, as new mining equipment still tends to become worthless in a matter of a couple years. So as that discount decreases, electricity use will increase, all else being equal.",1626905604,2021-07-22

I think you are greatly underestimating the customer base as well. There are plenty of people who live in rural areas that will buy the service. Also they will almost certainly adjust their price structure for customers in developing countries.

Bitcoin,"Even though you‚Äôre probably just trolling me, since you‚Äôve expended enough time and energy to comment twice, I‚Äôve added paragraphs here for you, to make the content more approachable. Enjoy:

Elon, the energy cost from bitcoin mining is proportional to its monetary value. Mining is a competition where each participant is incentivized to spend as much money on equipment and electricity as is profitable. This market will exist for any truly decentralized cryptocurrency.

Other cryptos cost less to mine right now because they are worth less, not because they provide more transactions per block. Bitcoin started with just one computer in 2008, using a CPU to process blocks. It could scale back down to that size one day if people stopped valuing it and discontinued mining.

The majority of energy used to mine is not spent on processing and recording transactions, it is spent on ‚Äúrolling dice‚Äù for a chance to be the winner of each block and receive the associated transaction fees and block reward.

Elon, your affinity for other cryptos with increased block size and block time may be functional for some nodes who have access to gigabyte Ethernet and abundant hard drive space, but that‚Äôs not scalable globally right now. People in many countries cannot afford multiple terabyte hard drives to store the entire blockchain.

Currently, Bitcoin requires less than one Terabyte, and that‚Äôs after 10 years of use. The risk of such a change, to faster block times and larger block size, is that we could see a choke point emerge with cloud hosting becoming the only way to support and participate in a larger blockchain network, as is the case for E, which relies on Amazon Web Services running Infura.

E is not decentralized and will become increasingly political with a transition to proof of stake, if they are able to accomplish this. The point of bitcoin is to overcome human directed monetary systems that can be influenced by majority stakeholders, lobbyists, or law makers.

Bitcoin is a responsive system that scales up and down, seeking out stranded energy, providing a new way to use excess energy globally, and communicate value broadly. It is absolutely scarce, just like our time. This is what makes it worth trading our time and energy for.",1626904852,2021-07-22

We cannot assume that with fewer bitcoin being issued the price would remain constant and thus, less energy would be used. The pattern over time has actually been for the price of bitcoin in fiat terms to rise relative to its halvings, scarcity. Since price is what drives willingness to mine and spend electricity, a higher priced lower issued snapshot of a blockchain would incentivize the same amount of energy use as a higher issued lower value coin that had the same total market cap.

Bitcoin,"&gt;You shouldn't take your own lifetime as measure of the success or not of economic policies. I was there in 08 and earlier.

Not sure what gave you that impression, gold and silver worked for several thousand years. A dollar is an ounce of silver, the USD is monopoly money; it's a broken promise.

&gt;The fact it's harder to retire is due to the aging of population and lowering pensions.

Or the fact that USD isn't worth as much as it used to be.

Bitcoin,"Yes, there are some important factors I've glossed over, but I was only addressing the most fundamental factor that I see. Here are the others:

1. Fees. Bitcoin's mining revenue (and thus its eventual electricity use) is currently dominated by block rewards. As the block reward continues to halve every 4 years, fees will become a relatively more significant factor. Will fee revenue increase as well? As long as we hold to 1MB blocks, fee revenue will be proportional to the value the market places on on-chain transactions. Since we are shifting toward most transactions being on second layers like LN, I think on-chain fees will not get too high, but who knows.
2. Time value of capital equipment for mining. Miners currently spend a lot less on electricity than they make in gross revenue, something around 10% at the moment. This is likely due to significant capital costs that need to be recouped over a limited time period as hardware becomes obsolete relatively quickly. As mining chip technology plateaus in terms of hashes per joule, or as least improves much more slowly than the last decade has seen, equipment will last longer and miners will be willing to spend more of their revenue on electricity. Thus we can expect an upward trend in electricity use relative to Bitcoin's price (within 4-year periods) and to daily block rewards (over longer periods).",1626904152,2021-07-22

Bitcoin,"&gt;Other cryptos cost less to mine right now because they are worth less, not because they provide more transactions per block.

It's not quite that simple. In the long run, the amount of money spent per day on the ongoing resources needed for mining (for Bitcoin, that's primarily electricity; for Chia it's expendable SSDs) will trend towards the value of the increase in supply per day.

Yes, within a 4-year halving window, you can expect bitcoin mining's electricity use to correlate to the price of bitcoin, because the daily increase in supply is constant.

But you can't do that same simple comparison between different coins. Take a hypothetical altcoin (let's call it Pinecoin) that is similar to Bitcoin in every way, including current price, except its block reward is currently 3.125 units per block instead of Bitcoin's 6.25 units per block. We can expect Pinecoin miners as a whole to use only half as much electricity as Bitcoin miners do as a whole.

The interesting result of this is that Bitcoin will be like this hypothetical Pinecoin in a few years.

So I don't think it's accurate to say that other coins' mining uses less electricity just because they're worth less.",1626903488,2021-07-22

Bitcoin,"&gt; if you earn your BTC, that's yours and yours only.

We were talking about capital gains taxes, not income taxes. No, you did not earn capital gains.

&gt; You still don't get it, you can't impose rules in stuff you can't control... that's just delusional

They can control it just fine, don't know why you think they can't. Hypothetical example:

* 1) If/when fiat is on the back foot, remove it entirely and require bitcoin to be the method of income deposits.

* 2) You are now required to register your bitcoin addresses and cannot legally receive any income at an unregistered address (doesn't need to be income tax, this is just for tracking not necessarily the source of tax accounting). If you don't and cannot show receipts for your lifestyle going through registered addresses, apply jail/fines etc as needed until complying.

* 3) Any time bitcoin leaves a registered address of yours and goes to any unknown address, it is legally considered to still be yours until such time as it gets to a registered address of a different person, and you still owe taxes on it same as if it hadn't moved. Apply jail/fines/wage garnishing/liens/reposessions/etc as required until complying.

Bitcoin,"""Not your keys, not your coin""

Basically until you control the private keys for your Bitcoin, you suffer the realities of counter party risk.

This means that even if an exchange is secure, if the government under which it (the exchange) resides forced them to give up all their holdings, your BTC would be part of that.

Furthermore, by leaving your coin on the exchange, you are centralizing coins in one entity.  Do yourself and the rest of the community a favor and even if you don't buy a hardware wallet, sign up for a phone wallet like Blue or Exodus and move your coin there",1626901842,2021-07-22

Bitcoin,"The benefit of cold storage is you are basically your own bank and control the funds fully. The negative of keeping it on an exchange is that your account can be hacked, coinbase technically just has an IOU to you (kinda like if u keep money in a Venmo or cashapp account), and coinbase itself can get hacked which would cause u to lose ur coins. Back in the early days of crypto many exchanges were hacked and all the customers had lost all their coins. Personally I believe the market has matured and something like coinbase (a publicly traded US company) is very very secure. 

It really is a ‚Äúto each their own‚Äù scenario. I have a friend who keeps 6 figs on coinbase for multiple years, and another friend who uses cold storage for .2 BTC. Many people on this sub will tell that holding your own keys is the only way to do it and if u keep it on exchanges you‚Äôre bound to lose it, but that simply isn‚Äôt true. If you feel comfortable having that much on an exchange go for it. But keep in mind bitcoin transactions are irreversible. It‚Äôs not like if ur bank account gets hacked the bank has ur back and will refund you. If ur coinbase gets screwed, you‚Äôre screwed.",1626901806,2021-07-22

He doesn't have the charisma but he has the vision and the drive to get things done.  For one I think it's refreshing to have someone with less of a filter, more mission-focused rather than image-focused.

Here's a good definition according to Investopedia:

What Is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)?

Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy in which an investor divides up the total amount to be invested across periodic purchases of a target asset in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. The purchases occur regardless of the asset's price and at regular intervals. In effect, this strategy removes much of the detailed work of attempting to time the market in order to make purchases of equities at the best prices. Dollar-cost averaging is also known as the constant dollar plan.",1626900456,2021-07-22

Bitcoin,"This is not a fair point, it's stupid and shallow.  Comparing building cars to mining cryptocurrency is asinine.  The two things are apples and oranges.  

If Tesla is successful they will remove tens of millions of internal combustion engines from the world and completely remake how people think about transportation and car ownership.  Elon has always said the best car is no car at all.  That's revolutionary and will have a tremendous effect on net greenhouse emissions.  

If Bitcoin is successful it will have similar world changing effects, but in theory it could do so while actually increasing net greenhouse emissions.  Bitcoin's mission is important, but it had nothing to do with Tesla's mission of decreasing greenhouse emissions.  If Elon's criticisms of Bitcoin help push more miners into renewable sources of energy that's a huge win.

Both things are important,and both things can be successful totally independent of one another.  It's absurd to think say :

Since there are taxes, wealth is being concentrated like crazy in the world

It's in fiat economies where there are poor people
While at the same time the rulers (politicians and their rich friends) are filthy rich

In the bitcoin economy, no one who has been saving for a cycle (4 years) stacking sats is poor

Choose wisely

Taxes (theft) are the base to finance all the fiat monetary rules that allow the concentration

If you believe the only way to fund projects is by crime (theft) then yes, you should stay were you are, Bitcoin is not for you

About your second paragraph, you're describing fiat rules... that's not how Bitcoin works, sorry to break it to you, but you need to do a lot of research on Bitcoin

The rules of Bitcoin are public and the same for every Bitcoiner, if you don't like them, you just don't participate

Violence is not a part of the Bitcoin system
I understand fiat regimes use it for everything, but it's pointless to apply it on Bitcoin. It's impossible to alter the code by a specific order from some person or entity, that's just not how it works...

The best thing one could do for poor people is teach them how to save their own sats

Saving is the only way out of poverty and governments are doing the opposite to people, they give out brrrr money to poor people (making them dependent on governments), that money dilutes it's purchasing power and they teach them nothing about finance

Bitcoin,"https://www.enerdynamics.com/Energy-Currents_Blog/How-Much-Primary-Energy-Is-Wasted-Before-Consumers-See-Value-from-Electricity.aspx

&gt; Ever wonder how much of the primary energy that goes into creating electricity actual provides useful work to us as consumers? Well the answer is not much ‚Äì depending on the device using electricity it‚Äôs anywhere from 30% to as little as 5%. So, where does all that wasted energy go and what can we do about it? Or is it even worth trying? To address these questions, let‚Äôs look at where electricity is lost in the delivery chain.
&gt; 
&gt; Losses in generation, transmission, and distribution First, let‚Äôs consider the primary energy that enters the electric delivery system at the input to the generator and examine how much of the primary energy is delivered to the customer. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the answer is 34%. In other words, 66% of the primary energy used to create electricity is wasted by the time the electricity arrives at the customer meter.

Other sources claim that 17% of all power generated is wasted in the generation and transmission (with or without Bitcoin). Bitcoin uses one twentieth of one percent of all power:: 0.05 vs 17.0 percent.

Bitcoin's energy usage is not a problem - there is a lot of deception being pushed.  Congratulations, you've been deceived.

With Sweden and lets say nordic countries... they have nearly completely nationalized healthcare and for that, they need to pay extremely high taxes. It provides ""free"" healthcare to everyone, but... if customers can decide between at first look free over paid, they will nearly always pcik free... private centers are going nearly bankrupt while state owned healtcare is exploding with people. 

According to what i have read, people are suffering in the hospitals waiting for doctors even a few hours. Urgent is full all the time etc. Hospitals dont have any incentive to hire good and professional experts so they hire the ones with lowest salary.

As i have said and keep in mind that i dont live there and i have it from online sources, there is everything free but at the same time, everything is missing. If you chose private hospital or doctor and pay him, you have it nearly instant and with great standard. Why people dont do that? because they tax 70 % of their income (all taxes) so even if they wanted, its too much.

I completely agree with helping the ones in need, but it should be done differently than fucking up the whle industry. Lower taxes and let people pay for their needs. Let them have money for insurance, let them have responsibility but also the choice to pick where and how they want to be treated. I would say the nearly everyone is capable and should be allowed to do that. I hate socialist systems because they promote zero responsibility while reducing freedom. They can be done differently. 

Take it all with grain of salt, i am as far from expert as one can be, logic and online sources are everything i have, so there is long road ahead of me... still, now, there is probably nobody who can convince me, that socialist systems dont produce shortages and surpluses, which are inefficient and in the long run, they lose compared to free market.

Bitcoin,"You don't seem to understand where fiat currencies get their value. The value of currency is based on the ""full faith and credit"" of the government.

In practice, this means the government will jail you if you don't pay your taxes in fiat. They can also shut down your business if you refuse to accept their currency. This backing is just as ""real"" as the promise of shiny metal. The dollar can only go to zero if the government collapses, in which case all your investments will go to zero.

There's nothing magical about gold. It has some intrinsic value for jewelry and electronics manufacture, but its value is based on the idea that people think it's valuable.

The same goes for Bitcoin, and there's nothing wrong with that. You could argue that Bitcoin is ""harder"" than gold, due to scarcity, security and decentralization. That's why I like it, but I still target only 10% of my portfolio in crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I understand that fiat currencies always go to zero.

Based on what? What major currency has ever gone to zero absent war or an economic collapse?

If you really believe the dollar is going to zero, you should buy shovels and shotguns instead of Bitcoin. If the dollar fails, the electrical grid will go down shortly after.

The Fed is *definitely* printing too much money during the pandemic, but if the Fed has been ""failing for decades"", why is inflation just now ramping up? You do realize that before the Fed, there was a panic or depression every 10 years or so?

If you're worried about inflation (as I am), it should concern you that Bitcoin drops along with other assets when inflation is in the news. It seems like an imperfect hedge, but I think the situation will improve over time.

Bitcoin,"https://www.enerdynamics.com/Energy-Currents_Blog/How-Much-Primary-Energy-Is-Wasted-Before-Consumers-See-Value-from-Electricity.aspx

&gt; Ever wonder how much of the primary energy that goes into creating electricity actual provides useful work to us as consumers? Well the answer is not much ‚Äì depending on the device using electricity it‚Äôs anywhere from 30% to as little as 5%. So, where does all that wasted energy go and what can we do about it? Or is it even worth trying? To address these questions, let‚Äôs look at where electricity is lost in the delivery chain.
&gt; 
&gt; Losses in generation, transmission, and distribution First, let‚Äôs consider the primary energy that enters the electric delivery system at the input to the generator and examine how much of the primary energy is delivered to the customer. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the answer is 34%. In other words, 66% of the primary energy used to create electricity is wasted by the time the electricity arrives at the customer meter.

Other sources claim that 17% of all power generated is wasted in the generation and transmission (with or without Bitcoin). Bitcoin uses one twentieth of one percent of all power:: 0.05 vs 17.0 percent.

Bitcoin's energy usage is not a problem - there is a lot of deception being pushed.

Remember: TA is pure bullshit. Day trading is for fools. Fools and their money are soon parted.

Bitcoin,"It's just open conversation. Other talk shows have a lot of airs and graces and you have to be careful what you say. The great thing about Joe Rogan and his podcast format is you can say what you want like you were just a couple of guys having a chat in a bar or strangers that met on a bus.

People may take shit he says seriously but that has always been the case. My parents used to say ""don't believe everything you see on tv"" and i am pretty sure my grandparents said the same to them. 

Most of the time he doesnt know what he is going to talk about so he can't research it beforehand. He does get Jamie to do fact checking but by the time Jamie finds what they are talking about they have moved on to another topic. Should Jamie then bring them back and explain whats really happening or let the flow of conversation keep going. 

Jamie will sometimes stop everything to correct them but i am sure it's a judgement call whenever he does. 

I guess my point is you can't take something he says on the show as his permanent immovable stance on the matter. He's a curious guy and if we were improvising a conversation on the internet we would say a lot of dumb shit too.",1626895366,2021-07-22

My public education, from about 4th until 12 grade was mostly a clusterfuck.  I got to learn a lot of math, but that was kind of by mistake.  For example, I had 6 years of one foreign language, graduated, and during the summer found I was unable to use that language to give simple directions to a tourist who needed to get to a certain place.  I had extremely poor grammar and spelling. My vocabulary was rather small.  I was a very slow reader with low comprehension.  School, for me up until college, was a big tax-funded ""babysitting"" service, mostly.  

Somehow (because of the math), I got accepted to a decent University, where I became interested in actually learning things because they were interesting and because it was fun -- I had a very, very deep curiosity.  

Eventually, I realized I needed to graduate and get a job, so I did.  Maybe someday I'll go back.  In the meanwhile, I use the Internet, books, and so forth to learn new things on my own.

Bitcoin,"The middlemen are smart.  They borrow BTC from one group, then turn around and lend it to the people dumb enough to want to short Bitcoin.  They charge the short sellers fees and interest.  But from whom do these middlemen borrow BTC?

You see, there are certain Bitcoin owners who are unwise / not smart / inexperienced.  They think that ""earning interest"" on their Bitcoins is a good idea, but it isn't.  They lend their Bitcoins to the middlemen and they take on various risks for a relatively small amount of reward.

You see, the long term average ROI for holding Bitcoin is about 100% per year.  One hundred percent per year.  That means, on average, long term, the value of held BTC doubles.

Double one dollar, ten times.

Answer: &gt;!1,000!&lt;  

&amp;#x200B;

So, $5,000 invested in Bitcoin for about ten years should be about &gt;!$5 million, give or take.!&lt;  This fabulous rate of return requires no unnecessary risk.  

So, there are dumb-dumbs who choose to risk losing their Bitcoins to try to get 105% instead of a ""measly"" 100%.  

The relatively small reward is nowhere near being worth the risk.  

The middlemen don't take (much) risk.  They pass it on to the ""dumb-dumbs"".  Whether the short seller wins or loses, the middlemen come out ahead.  So, don't believe people who tell you it's safe to short or that it's safe to lend Bitcoins -- chances are, they're shills for the middlemen or they're clueless stooges, repeating what they don't understand.",1626893844,2021-07-22

Bitcoin,"Nope.

The mining gear is ever evolving (Moore‚Äôs law). Have a look at the efficiency of the s9, s15, s17, s19.

The electricity cost isn‚Äôt the same from region to region and country to country. Mining somewhere in USA at 5cents of USD/kWh isn‚Äôt as difficult of mining in Germany with 36cents of EUR/kWh.

Then there is the procurement problem. Hobby miner are paying scalper price for new tech VS the industrial miner buying by the bulk. Or hobby miner will get a good deal on antiquated tech which lower the cost of entry but will push them off the network sooner.

At scale you also have the maintenance to pay for. Salary aren‚Äôt equal in western countries as in emerging countries or third world countries. 

Every would be miner is dealt with another hand and someone in Germany could be operating a s9 at a loss, when someone in Greenland would be operating a 1000 s19 at incredible profit.

Also, difficulty follow price. You can‚Äôt correlate difficulty to halving event. Last halving saw a drop in difficulty to adjust for lack of profitability. If the price of bitcoin doesn‚Äôt double after a halving event, it could very well be that the difficulty drop by 50% as the less profitable miner will be pushed off the network.",1626893116,2021-07-22

Bitcoin,"&gt;	Bro, I‚Äôm sure you think this is all very enlightened, but you are basically a caricature of an edgy athiest right now. Pointing out that there is no proof of God isn‚Äôt smart. Saying that believing in God is like talking to Santa Clause is banal.

Don‚Äôt put words in my mouth, I neither said nor implied that I think god doesn‚Äôt exist. I explicitly created my argument in a way that is independent of that consideration.

&gt;	Despite the fact that you have formed part of your identity from the fact that you don‚Äôt believe, there are those that do, and they aren‚Äôt crazy. Because there is no proof that a god doesn‚Äôt exist. So just let it rest. Likening religious people to those with mental illness is dangerous, and stupid. Don‚Äôt do that.

That‚Äôs like, just your opinion. There is plenty historical **evidence** of religious activity that is indistinguishable from mental illnesses. Mass suicides, genocides, infanticide, mutilations, torture, murder, celebrating the burning of innocent women at the stake etc. 

Again, it doesn‚Äôt **matter** wether god exists or not for my argument to be true. Objectively insane behaviour is insane regardless of that. Pretty sure god if he exists wouldn‚Äôt agree with everything that was done in his name either, lotta people prolly really regretted finally meeting their maker in those cases.

P.S. There is at least **proof** that **some** gods don‚Äôt exist, because there are many gods worshipped on this world and they ruled each other‚Äôs existence out in their communication with their respective followers. So we are really debating wether it‚Äôs this or that group of billions of people that are wrong. And yes, that includes atheists.",1626892929,2021-07-22

&gt; More about this chart
&gt; Explanation
&gt; The difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to mine a Bitcoin block, or in more technical terms, to find a hash below a given target. A high difficulty means that it will take more computing power to mine the same number of blocks, making the network more secure against attacks. The difficulty adjustment is directly related to the total estimated mining power estimated in the Total Hash Rate (TH/s) chart.
&gt; Notes
&gt; The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks (every 2 weeks approximately) so that the average time between each block remains 10 minutes.
&gt; Methodology
&gt; The difficulty comes directly from the confirmed blocks data in the Bitcoin network.",1626892906,2021-07-22

The rest of uses like decentralised apps, like paying for a database, don't need to necessarily be decentralised and it is cumbersome and inefficient to maintain that in a blockchain.

Bitcoin,"&gt; What do you think happened with the price of gold right after that??

When they raise the value of a dollar on the gold standard, it's a tax on everyone with dollars. If you choose to call taxes ""theft"" then okay, but it isn't specific to guys who happened to have gold previously, it was an instant money printing equivalent to the entire economy whenever they change the price under the standard. You could have held gold you could have not held gold, your savings were affected either way. 

So even if they had news of this from a prophetic dream years earlier, it wouldn't have been a reason to have avoided holding gold in the 1920s earlier on.

It might have been a reason to SNEAK it around, but that's pretty damn hard to do with bitcoin since it's publicly trackable and all (see point 2)

&gt; You should only be using non KYC exchanges

Never heard of a non KYC exchange, except the ones that were banned for not being KYC that I cannot use because of that.

&gt; It would happen because Bitcoin undermines the whole traditional financial structure. Once 2 people use Bitcoin, they can do commerce without needing financial institutions

This is a more tinfoil-y theory of ""taking out vague competitors for vague reasons"" than your gold example, which was just about straight up solvency and (when combined with later raising of gold prices by definition like you mention) as a tax. It was about good solid concrete obvious Bookkeeping and revenue etc. not something like spycraft.

This would accomplish nothing like that, so it's pretty much a completely different theory that you need to argue coherently from scratch, not by pointing to hsitorical examples that... don't match it.",1626888739,2021-07-22

Bitcoin,"&gt; With that large of a drop in miners, the possibility of a coordinated 51% attack because becomes much easier, simply because the overwhelming majority of miners maintaining and building true blocks on the blockchain have been removed

Logic fail  

An attack would only be possible if enough of the disconnected mining hardware could be reconnected in a conspiracy. Bitcoin can not be attacked with a PC, or even a million PCs. The only spare ASIC miners are the ones which were recently removed from the network. Most of them have no home yet. They are owned by hundreds of thousands of people. No conspiracy is possible  

The hash rate has since recovered to 100 Exahash/sec

&gt; worth noting that #11 Calculations in the original paper goes through the probability of a successful attack and how they could be implemented

That calculation assumes an attack which replaces one block at a time. An attacker can avoid the decreasing probability problem by shadow mining several blocks in secret in parallel with the regular mining network, and with more hash power  

The 2020 Bitcoin Gold attack was implemented by renting hashes on the NiceHash hashing exchange. It cost about $1700 to rent enough hash power to overtake the regular miners for 2 hours. The attackers mined 2 hours of blocks in secret, and then replaced the regular miners' last 2 hours of blocks with their own. The attackers' double-spend profits were much greater than the cost of the attack  

The other thing Satoshi didn't predict was that coin-to-coin exchanges would be an easy double-spend target  

There are almost zero SHA256 hashes available to rent on NiceHash or similar markets. Do you know why?  

Future risk: watch for the Bitcoin price to fall below $2000, and the hash rate to fall to 3 Exahash/sec. Then watch for the retired miners to list at least 4 Exahash of SHA256 on Nicehash  

Even then, an attack needs a victim. Coin-to-coin exchanges can only be defrauded a few times before they work out how to increase confirmation times for coins with weak hash rates",1626887292,2021-07-22

*However* one argument against that is that things really are different this time.  No, for real.  There is more traditional investor interest than in the past, and stablecoin regulation may bring more clarity and certainty that enables hedge funds and institutional investors to allocate more funds to bitcoin and crypto, and we may then finally see Bitcoin and crypto ETFs.

Furthermore, significantly more people are now aware of the cyclical nature of bitcoin spikes that correlate with mining reward halving events.  Expect more people to start ‚Äúloading up‚Äù at some point in 2023, at the latest, in anticipation of this.  However, that may drive up the price a bit, so many people that know this will want to get in a bit earlier‚Äîlike late 2022 (a 100%+ return in 2 - 3 years ain‚Äôt so bad!), and that may make any cooling off period shorter than the ‚Äúlong winters‚Äù of the past.",1626887260,2021-07-22

Another one I'm looking forward to is wallet vaults where you have a third party controlling one key in a multisig like address. The third party can help you recover if you lose all your keys, but can't steal from you (unless, again, you lose all your keys). Also, I created [a proposal](https://github.com/fresheneesz/bip-efficient-bitcoin-vaults) for a wallet vault where in one transaction you could send money to someone else directly from your wallet vault while still having buffer time to reverse the transaction in the case it was a mistake or theft attempt.

Bitcoin,"Your comments make no sense, that's why you are being downvoted.  GBTC shares are backed by actual BTC.
If you buy a GBTC share from someone else, of course the fund is not going to buy additional BTC in the open market.  That would be like saying that if I bought BTC from someone on an exchange, the exchange would have to buy additional BTC, which makes no sense.  If demand for GBTC shares is higher than the supply, the premium will go up, and additional BTC will be bought or sent for conversion to the fund (providing buy pressure on the spot market), if demand for GBTC shares is lower than supply, the premium will be negative, and people can arbitrage by buying GBTC and selling spot, providing selling pressure on the spot market). So obviously it has an influence on the spot market.",1626884386,2021-07-22

Anyway, congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.

Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, nor next week. Statistically, it's less than four years from now. Anyone who bought Bitcoin at any point in the past and held it for 4+ years is in profit. 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least first year**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to.

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for SATs. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://amber.app/calculate-your-investment/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference.

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at etoro, RH, PayPal or similar, get the real thing. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://www.wasabiwallet.io/](https://www.wasabiwallet.io/) \- Excellent privacy, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets.

https://bluewallet.io - easy to use, Open Source, Non-custodial (although I believe LN is custodial if not using own node)

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix works on Android or iOS

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - Android or iOS

https://muun.com - Muun - another non custodial LN wallet working on Android and iOS

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words safe.

Bitcoin,"https://www.enerdynamics.com/Energy-Currents_Blog/How-Much-Primary-Energy-Is-Wasted-Before-Consumers-See-Value-from-Electricity.aspx

&gt; Ever wonder how much of the primary energy that goes into creating electricity actual provides useful work to us as consumers? Well the answer is not much ‚Äì depending on the device using electricity it‚Äôs anywhere from 30% to as little as 5%. So, where does all that wasted energy go and what can we do about it? Or is it even worth trying? To address these questions, let‚Äôs look at where electricity is lost in the delivery chain.  
&gt; 
&gt; Losses in generation, transmission, and distribution
First, let‚Äôs consider the primary energy that enters the electric delivery system at the input to the generator and examine how much of the primary energy is delivered to the customer. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the answer is 34%. In other words, 66% of the primary energy used to create electricity is wasted by the time the electricity arrives at the customer meter. 

Other sources claim that 17% of all power generated is wasted in the generation and transmission (with or without Bitcoin). Bitcoin uses one twentieth of one percent of all power:: 0.05 vs 17.0 percent.

Bitcoin's energy usage is not a problem - you have been deceived.

The proposed law is targeting businesses and not consumers.

I kept pasting this in info across many threads like this one (Sorry for those who keep stumbling on this copy pasta)

&gt;The anonymity of crypto-assets exposes them to risks of misuse for criminal purposes. Anonymous crypto-asset wallets do not allow the traceability of crypto-asset transfers, whilst also making it difficult to identify linked transactions that may raise suspicion or to apply to adequate level of customer due diligence. **In order to ensure effective application of AML/CFT requirements to crypto-assets, it is necessary to prohibit the provision and the custody of anonymous crypto-asset wallets by crypto-asset service providers.**

First:  
Not your keys, not your coins!

Second:  
Don't accept wallet keys that were generated by a third party.  Don't be lazy and do it yourself (there is nowhere to be found in the proposed law that you'll be force to obtain a wallet from a service provider).

Third:  
This isn't the traditional banking system.  You shouldn't use a third party to send coins to your friend that lives on the other side of the blue marble.

And at last:  
Don't Trust. Verify.

How useful was the computer to people in the 1970s? Of course you cannot envision how this thing is useful to you because it is not widely adopted or utilized or even matured.

Have you seen everything that's going on in the defi space? It's mind-blowing. It's completely revolutionizing modern finance. Until you start researching these ecosystems and trying to wrap your head around all of the use cases you won't understand how it could eventually apply to you.

In the future you won't need to call up a car insurance company you will just stake some crypto on a system that provides you decentralized insurance.

Want to take a equity loan on your home? You'll have the equity in your home tokenized already and you'll be able to stake those tokens within a system to receive USDC (or whatever coin you desire) as a loan. And you'll get it at rates far more competitive than what centralized systems have to offer.

There have been 2 subsequent bear markets (we are in #3), that also *average* about 461 days. Those markets resulted in a roughly 82% decline from peak to trough.

If history is a prelude, then this last bear market started mid-April and we can expect it to go through August 2022, with a decline in price down to $11,182.

At that point, another bull market will start and over 460 days, it will top out around $345,000 in December of 2023. Then, another 80% decline down to $63,000 (interesting, near our current top), and then another leg-up to $1,875MM in August, 2026, putting the BTC market cap at a whopping $40T - flipping gold, silver, and moving into bonds.

Hopefully it will also be more secure than the current smart contract shitcoins, which mostly rely on trustfully wrapped BTC and therefore are no better than a centralized service.

Bitcoin,"I don't know.  A lot of people are pretty fucking stupid.  

Last night I went to pick up some food.  As I pulled into the parking lot, I almost got nailed by a woman in a minivan, coming head-on in my lane.  She was staring at her phone.  

I might go buy a big, big ""monster truck,"" then take it to the offroad guys and have a huge metal ""tree basher"" thing welded to the front.  Next time some dumbfuck comes at me, I'll just send them to heaven.  

My point here, though, is that most people are controlled by brainwashing.  Furthermore, and interestingly, if you try to explain to them, and even clearly demonstrate to them that their minds have been manipulated, they'll agree that everybody ELSE has been brainwashed, but that it doesn't affect them, even though it does.  

In fact, you're probably thinking the same thing while you read that.  

Long ago, marketing people figured out how to implant their messages into people's minds.  They DON'T do it by being logical and explaining the facts.  

I mean, if you remember the Marlborough Man billboards and magazine ads.   What the fuck?  But it worked.  Show boys a picture of a manly-man in a big hat, with a rope... make them want to smoke.  I mean, just think of trying to logically explain to a person that they should smoke:

What's that?  
*A cigarette.  You burn it, and inhale the smoke and fumes*.  
Why?  
*Because you'll get addicted to it.  It's poisonous; it could kill you someday.  It's an expensive, dirty habit and it makes you look stupid to other people*.  

Right?

As a grown man who does not smoke, I look at those same billboards and think, ""Oh, a handsome homosexual man who is into fantasy costumes.  He wants somebody to tie him up with that rope...  What the FUCK does this have to do with cigarettes?""  

That guy died of lung cancer, by the way.  For real.

Again, the point here is: You and I are comfortable dealing with facts, logic, reason, truth, math, etc.  Most people are driven by their emotions, mostly fears, anxieties, insecurities, fantasies, etc. and this allows the propagandists/marketing guys to manipulate them.",1626876260,2021-07-21

One block has a maximum of 4MB of space for transactions, and there is a variable global demand to commit transactions into that block.  There's your supply/demand market.

If the network is very slow, and if blocks are not even filling up with transactions, you don't need to pay any kind of rush fee at all to guarantee quick finality.

If you absolutely MUST have your transaction confirmed, and the network is full of activity (the mempool is growing in size), you will need to pay a higher rush fee to transact because the miners naturally aim for transactions with higher fees.",1626875826,2021-07-21

That's my point. It's designed to be traceable. In theory anyone can trace every transaction ever made. 

How could they centralize bitcoin? They could make a law that you have to use their exchange for all transactions but they might as well make a law that it's illegal to wipe your ass from back to front. They have no way to enforce it.

Just like the second layer apps on top of the Internet (TCP/IP) base protocol.

Base layers/protocols are basic infrastructure built for security not for 'speed', are a strong and stable foundation upon which all the functional layers are built on top of.

In your house you are building you want high-voltage electrical wires, solar panels, double-panneled windows, central AC, a pool and jacuzzi, extra rooms for visitors. etc? You build all of that on top of the strong foundation, not buried on the cement and unable to change, upgrade or even use them.


So, EVERYTHING will be implemented on top of Bitcoin, just see some the advances so far this early in the game:

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; RSK Network, the safest smart contract platform in the world that is secured by the Bitcoin Network, has surpassed Lighting Network (LN) total value locked in Bitcoin (BTC), and now stands at 1,445 BTCs locked. The latest milestone is another sign of a strong appetite among users for the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector, which defined 2020 and has extended well into the current year.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; RSK smart contracts platform had over 259,000 transactions, 50,000 active accounts and reached an all time high of 72% hashing power during April. The amount of solutions and integrations in the RSK defi ecosystem has experienced a significant growth over the last couple of months.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; A new project built on the Bitcoin sidechain RSK is gunning to advance decentralized finance (DeFi) on Bitcoin‚Äôs ecosystem.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sovryn, a self-billed ‚Äúdecentralized platform for trading and lending Bitcoin,‚Äù launched today with $2.1 million at its back ‚Äì a symbolic number representing Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply. Crypto venture capital firm Greenfield One led the funding round, which also saw contributions from Collider Ventures and Monday Capital.

&gt; **What is RGB?**
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; RGB is a scalable &amp; confidential smart contracts system for Bitcoin &amp; lightning network. They embrace concepts of private &amp; mutual ownership, abstraction and separation of concerns and represent ""post-blockchain"", Turing-complete form of trustless distributed computing which does not require introduction of ""tokens"".
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; RGB is not a token protocol. Though issuance and management of highly scalable, programmable and private assets of different sort is possible with RGB, it can be applied in many indusrtied far beyond financial world.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As a smart contract system RGB is quite different from previous approaches, both Bitcoin-based (Colored coins, Counterparty, OMNI) and non-bitcoin (Ethereum, EOS and others):
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; * RGB separates concept of smart contract issuer, state owners and state evolution
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; * RGB keeps the smart contract code and data off-chain
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; * RGB uses blockchain as a state commitment layer and Bitcoin script as an ownership control system; while smart contract evolution is defined by off-chain schema

Actually, Bitcoins are stored on an immutable public ledger.  There are tens of thousands of exact copies of this ledger which is updated about once every ten minutes on average.  

The fact is, a person can store their **seed phrase** (private keys) on a USB drive, but that would not be very secure.  

Bitcoin is here to stay. You owe it to yourself, therefore, to learn the basic facts about it - the sooner you do, the better for you, in the long term.

Bitcoin was never meant to be anonymous. An open ledger is a good thing and it is working as intended. The banking system is anonymous... for rich people only. Bitcoin fixes that. You will be able to track down anyone and expose vile actors if necessary.

Also, your post seems to suggest Bitcoin is great, but also that you don't like it. It's very wierd and misleading.

As for P2P, we will see. Understand that this is going to be a long process and although it was intended to act as a P2P system, it doesn't have to achieve that in order to have a significant lasting impact on the economy. Store of value is a critical feature and I would never downplay this. This by far the best form of hard money humanity ever had.

I would suggest you start learning about the history of money and then more about Bitcoin also instead of doing it casually because your point of view IMHO is flawed and misinformed. I suggest you read The Bitcoin Standard, then and only then this whole thing will start making sense to you. You can't understand Bitcoin if you don't understand the basics of economics first.

You take a 10% loan from your 100k collateral which means a loan of 10k.

That following year your 100k starting capital is now 300k thanks to that 200% return.

You then take another 10% loan but now it's against the 300k.  That comes out to 30k.  You take 10k of that to pay off your first loan and live off or re-invest that extra 20k tax free.

Bitcoin,"&gt;Your mindset will probably change over the years from unexpected expenses (sickness, emergencies, helping family, etc), things you will want to buy (a cabin, nicer car, flying lessons, etc) and through fear (having x amount and being scared it plummets 90%).

That's why you're supposed to have cash reserves on hand before investing in anything. If all someone does is invest in Bitcoin without putting aside money for both immediate savings and more traditional investments (e.g., mutual funds), then they're setting yourself up for failure.",1626859041,2021-07-21

Bitcoin,"As a Brazilian born and raised I must disagree. The ‚Äújeitinho‚Äù is actually not seen as something immoral by most people so they probably think they are honest and decent people regardless. Most people don‚Äôt see how that is damaging to society in general until they live somewhere else where this is not a thing.

Granted that receiving a huge amount of money that isn‚Äôt yours would not qualify as ‚Äújeitinho‚Äù, anyone keeping that money would definitely be aware they were doing something bad. The ‚Äújeitinho‚Äù is more for small corruptions that are not seen as a big deal (that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called like that).

&gt;I believe that actually most Brazilians would be honest and return the money.

Ignoring the fact that this person _did not_ return all the money I‚Äôd say the vast majority of the time no money whatsoever would be returned. If you lose your wallet (physical cash wallet) somewhere in Brazil and you had cash in then don‚Äôt expect to get it back. You might get the wallet back but no cash inside.

This man probably thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing this guy a favor by returning 60%‚Äù when in reality the moral and correct thing to do would be to return all of the money, after all they‚Äôd _know_ that money isn‚Äôt theirs. It‚Äôs equivalent to finding a wallet in the street and keeping a few notes.

This type of thing makes me incredibly sad and shameful of being Brazilian because it‚Äôs so pervasive. And we dare complain about our corrupt politicians when the average citizen is just as corrupt but lacks access to the vast funds our politicians have.

Our country is so rich, if it were not so corrupt maybe we‚Äôd be doing great things on the world stage but alas that isn‚Äôt the case.",1626858509,2021-07-21

Not verification, just a declaration, without proof, of the identity of the counterparty. You could send Bitcoin to a friend and tell the exchange that the address is from your personal wallet. The exchange will accept the details without verification  

&gt; When they finally realize this, why wouldn't they just prohibit sending bitcoin to your own wallet altogether? effectively making a black and white bitcoin ecosystem

Maybe. There were a couple of threads discussing this as ""bifurcation"" when the travel rule was announced in 2019  

But what they realize now is that Bitcoin is not suitable for money laundering at the personal wallet level because it doesn't have enough liquidity, so they don't need to regulate personal wallets. They're probably concerned about unregulated exchanges. So, if all they get is ""withdrawing $350 to personal wallet"", there's no laundering, nothing to ban",1626857940,2021-07-21

- The initial group of developers of Bitcoin could have been hired by the CIA to develop the technology.

Bitcoin,"Agreed. Demographics are changing, boomers are reluctantly passing the torch (more like having it ripped from their death grip, but whatever works), and millennials and gen z are coming into their own. I don't see young people who were raised after the rise of the Internet putting the majority of their money into gold. Some, like the WSB crowd, like the stock market, but many more are turned off by investing in corporations that are corrupt and slimy. Bitcoin is the obvious alternative. I think that's one reason we get so much hate: people who hold gold or stocks see Bitcoin as a threat, and it is.

That said, I wouldn't say most here are hoping to become millionaires, not realistically. Sure, it would be great, but most just want enough money to put a down payment on a home or have some degree of short-term financial independence.

A hot wallet requires one to be connected to the internet, making it the most convenient but highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks, while a cold wallet offers a storage facility in offline mode.

Naw, because 1‚Çø is arbitrarily equal to 100M‚©ß instead of 1B‚©ß, it's weird as hell all the time.

Notice how big of a mess this is:

      1‚Çø    = 100M‚©ß
      100m‚Çø = 10M‚©ß
      10m‚Çø  = 1M‚©ß

      100n‚Çø = 10‚©ß
      10n‚Çø  = 1‚©ß

Compared to how clean it could have been:

      1‚Çø    = 1B‚©ß
      100m‚Çø = 100M‚©ß
      10m‚Çø  = 10M‚©ß

      100n‚Çø = 100‚©ß

The good ol' **Buy high, sell low** keeps working for many newcomers and it's sad. Buying other coins makes it even worse, especially once the bull is replaced with bear. 

The more you understand what Bitcoin really is about, the easier it gets.

Since I bought my first Bitcoin, I was under the water for more than a couple of long years. I was learning about it every single day and kept buying more after each paycheck. I was and still am at the ""I will die on this hill"" point. 

**The FUD, the shitcoins, the price in dollars, this all is just a noise.**

Learning about Bitcoin will get you understand why we all think, Bitcoin is revolutionary. Plenty of resources everywhere, a good place to start:

Or if you prefer videos: Who Wants To Be A Bitcoin Millionaire? - BBC Panorama I like this video because it's made for NoCoiners but still manages to explain how the whole technology works (second half). [https://youtu.be/Q0ZfftQxsYs](https://youtu.be/Q0ZfftQxsYs)

But how does bitcoin actually work? This video is a bit more technical, but still explains the block-chain technology in simple terms. [https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4](https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4)

2) If the same thing happened with bitcoin, having it in personal wallets would be unlikely to help you due to KYC already identifying people if needed, and you'd have to sell that too, or face fines/garnished wages/imprisonment, etc. So I don't think your advice really matters one way or the other here.

The article doesn't describe the effects of fractional banking and or others forms of money creation very well.

As a smart guy already stated ""inflation is always a monetary issue"".

A lot if people nowadays only think about increasing prices, or shrinking amounts for the same price when inflation is mentioned.
In it's original definition that is just the effect that increasing the money supply causes.

Almost everyone can call out the precieved ""advantages"" of inflation, the most stubborn and wrong one is that inflation is needed to keep the economy going (for those interested Google what sound money was used while the US saw the biggest wealth increasec over time overall). An other popular one is: it makes your loan cheaper over time.

But most don't know the one thing inflation has the biggest impact on and that is a negative effect, your pension.

Just realize your pension is for most the longest running financial aspect In their life and the biggest amount of money (yes in most cases way bigger than the second big ticket item: your mortgage).

Thus it shouldn't take much time to check inflation has overall a negative effect, but it is smartly hidden since most pension funds are collective and are done via an employer.
For fun check your overview, it mostly focus on the final achieved monthly payment, if everything goes according to plan..., but never clearly states what was put in and thus what the effectiveness was/is, let alone those schemes that depend on future contributions of the next generation, that mostly also assume inflation won't increase to some extent....",1626849765,2021-07-21

This is exactly the best scenario for whales to stack. They open shorts and they themselfs dump the price. At the end they win the bet and they get to buy again cheap. A win-win situation for then.

For common traders this is either good or bad. If you can actually predict the future then nice, otherwise you will get liquidated with such volatility.

For us hodlers this is good of course. Oportunities to buy again this cheap.is something many of us couldnt even imagine 3 months ago.

I think he was talking to the ""nice teller"" and the Karen overheard and in that case I cant really fault him.  He just thought he was having a friendly conversation, I prob would have done the same thing...",1626843062,2021-07-21

Bitcoin,"****1 Satoshi will = 1c USD eventually, most experts have estimates ranging from 5-10 years...
It currently sits at a -x29* of this...
With a total supply of 21million... ( not including what is yet to be mined or what is lost, conservative estimates are around 15-17 million)
And a current population of 7.674 billion...
The current equal representation per person for bitcoin is 0.0027272727272727 bitcoin per person....
At todays price that means its current value per person if every single person wanted their ""share"" of bitcoin would be about $96 usd...
The current world ""Gdp"" is $80,934,771,028,340... almost 81 trillion.
If every person on earth today owned their share of bitcoin its value to be $739,200,000,000.... only 739 billion.
With a multiplication value of only 29, this will only bring the price to $21,436,800,000,000.... 21 trillion....
This puts the equal representation per person for bitcoin of 0.0027272727272727 at about $2784. Pretty good return on investment of $96 to secure your ""share"" of bitcoin in todays price. 

If i have any understanding on human emotions when it comes to greed and FOMO, this means not everyone own some bitcoin, and the price will be MUCH higher than this. These etimates put the price per bitcoin at $1023000... PER BITCOIN.

None of this takes into consideration the potential infaltion % in the future, this is at todays current market value...****

I ran the numbers a few months ago so don't quote me on today's prices, but a 29√ó in the next 5-10 years is possible I think",1626842872,2021-07-21

No offense to anyone but he‚Äôs probably not gonna be around long enough to see the amazing things happening to Bitcoin in the next decade or so, and so is Charlie Munger. And since he probably does not understand how exactly does the whole system works nor did he take his time read and learn about it, thus his opinion on it is probably not as important to people. It‚Äôs like if you ask John Lennon how and why a supercharger is superior to a turbocharger, his answer is probably not that important to you if you are working on forced induction.",1626842827,2021-07-21

It would certainly affect trust if an attack was successful.

The game theory is pretty solid, anyone who has the hash power to produce a 51% attack would make more money contributing to the network.

I once received some 1k euros on a rechargeable card by an unknown person and called the bank, they got me in contact with this lady from a village in the south of Italy who made the mistake on the bank part and she told me that by law she was gonna pay the entire sum from her salary. The bank insisted I had no obligation to give back anything, but I never even considered keeping a single dime as it felt really wrong, so I sent the mony back to her and she was, like, the happiest person ever ahaha that made my day / week :D  (only difference with the braz guy is that had I took the mony to the casino I'd prolly make some bucks on top of it as I was a pro poker player at the time and kinda making a killing lol)",1626842558,2021-07-21
