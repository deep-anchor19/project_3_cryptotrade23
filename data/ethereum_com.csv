Eth Miners can basically preview what is about to go on chain, front run that order, hustle the original user out of money, and even censor Data by continiously throwing data in front of said data, unless you want to pay.

There is still not a true staking solution such as super linear staking

Pick N trusted and unconnected friends. Generate a seed phrase for each of them. Create a smart contract wallet (e.g Gnosis Safe) that allows spending by either N/2 of the friends keys or your own key alone.

Write a will specifying what will happen to your ETH. Include an explanation of what you have done.

Give each friend an envelope containing their seed phrase and instructions about the Gnosis Safe. Tell them not to tell anyone about the envelope. Don't tell them who other keyholders are. Ask them to open the envelope if you die and to give it back to you unopened if you live.

If you live, use your key to retrieve the funds. Get your friends to give you the unopened envelopes back.

If you die, the executors of your will have to make arrangements for the funds and appeal for the keyholders to come forward and release the funds.

This way you can only be betrayed by N/2 of your friends colluding against you, which given they don't even know each others identities is unlikely.

ethereum,"Trying to predict short term price movements isn't possible (unless you can manipulate the market), and trading on these price movements is pure gambling. You should look at it long term, and only invest what you are prepared to lose.

If you did your due diligence, and think Ethereum has room to grow and ETH is something you want to hold long term to invest, you could swap an amount of BTC for ETH. You need to find an amount that you will be comfortable with, so that you won' t regret and panic swap back on the first drop of the ETH/BTC ratio. But you also should consider the possibility that you will regret not swapping more when the ETH/BTC ratio goes up a lot, and so you should also not swap to little.

Personally I swapped all my BTC for ETH over time, and I haven' t regretted this a single moment. For my last swap it took over a year before I was back in profit again (on the ratio), but since I firmly believe the future of Ethereum is bright, and I like the community (especially the r/ethfinance community) and ecosystem much more than that of Bitcoin, it wasn't a problem for me to hold on to my Ether.

I think when BTC hits 100k (2.5x) ETH will see 10k (4x) no problem, it would be near 50% the market cap of BTC.

I moved 3y of accumulating BTC to 100% ETH at the start of this year. No regrets.

I also believe ETH can overtake BTC market cap someday. The use cases for ETH are growing expodentially whereas BTC is linear. If BTC can be selling for 100k (2.1T) eventually ETH at the same market cap would be selling for 18k, or an 800% upside from today, ~5 years.

Once additional halvings quit affecting BTC S2F and Ethereum has been deflationary for years due to POS I think it would have to take something tragic happening for BTC to 8x again.

I'm extremely biased towards Ethereum. Before ETH I couldn't put crypto to work for me, now it's all I try to do. My goal is to provide enough utility to other people with my assets that I can live rent free, I don't see that happening holding BTC unless I keep selling it off.",1626951636,2021-07-22

I personally think ethereum has a **much** brighter future than bitcoin and will eventually flip bitcoin to become the prime crypto asset. Ethereum does everything bitcoin does and so much more. Ethereum will soon become a productive asset and sustainably deflationary at the same time. Oh and doesn't waste country size amounts of energy.

The future early bitcoiners dreamt about is being built right now on Ethereum. Why? Because the Ethereum social contract allows for serious innovation as long as core values are upheld, contrary to the very rigid social contract of bitcoin.

In the end you should do your own research and make up your own mind. I would encourage you to look into eip1559 the merge and how PoS measures up to PoW when it comes to decentralization aka. the nakamoto coefficient and cost of attack.

BCH currently has some smart contract availability although it's nowhere near as robust as something like ETH.

Honestly when it comes down to it, there's a lot of value to a widespread network so if crypto is able to function as a simple payment system for everyone on earth, but a complete payment system would only allow for 2% of all people, the former is likely to be the more valuable resource.

On the other hand, if a complete payment system manages to scale to global levels, that will obviously be the most valuable network.

This is why I have heavy bets on both sides of the smart contract / simple payment crypto divide.

ethereum,"For large adoption with a very big transaction frequency, I'd consider several L2 to be absolutely required. And maybe even L3. 

Notably, a geographical L2 used by the shops of a given town would be a useful way to ensure minimal L1 commits: you don't need ultra high L1 security for your daily coffee transactions at the very same shops every time. 

All you need is to be able to transact quickly and cheaply and, when you travel or once per week or month or the like, be quickly able to secure all the transactions you've done in order to join another L2 or even come back clean to the same L2. 

This way, there is a very small pressure onto the L1, which ensures everything works fine, since any layer can only ensure so many transactions (which will grow with our tech to quickly transfer massive amounts of data between each others). 

Besides, if we really have so many transactions that even L2 prove to be insufficient, it means some L2 are heavily used, which also seems to mean they could themselves have some L3.

Currently, many blockchains claim to have very small transaction fees. It doesn't mean they'd handle even as many transactions as the Ethereum network without having to charge as much of a fee. Most of the ones who accurately claim this are heavily centralized.",1626925948,2021-07-22

As the market kept going down people just got more and more depressed and directed it towards Elon because it's convenient.

ethereum,"Maker would also collapse if ETH's value was to crater, too. Though less so than it would have back when ETH was the only collateral. The whole point of adding stablecoins like USDC was to mitigate the near-catastrophe Maker had back in March last year when a drop in ETH caused mass liquidations that couldn't be countered with ETH alone.

&gt; DAI should have a strict rule not to allow centralized assets as a collateral as it defeats the purpose it was created for in the first place.

Couple of problems with that. First, the purpose for which MakerDAO was created is to *maintain the peg of DAI to US dollars.* There's nothing in that that prohibits or requires any particular collateral types, MakerDAO's mandate is to go with whatever works to that end. Secondly, as this article says, MakerDAO is going to be fully decentralized now so the only ""strict rules"" left are the ones in the actual smart contract. It's up to MKR holders to decide what types of collateral to accept now. Decentralization means it's out of any particular group's control.

&gt; Better yet, it should've always stayed with only ETH as a single collateral, what's wrong with that.

We saw what was wrong with that back in March 2020, ETH's price suddenly dropped and there were mass liquidations. DAI nearly lost its peg. The whole point of multi-collateral is to diversify DAI's backing so that it's not as strongly affected by fluctuations in the price of any particular one.

At the end of the day, results are what matters. If DAI's peg fails then MKR holders will lose their money, so that's why it's up to them to make these decisions to prevent that from happening.",1626883881,2021-07-22

I'm well aware that your bank can have an agreement to pay the fees or whatever, but that's not what I'm talking about. Without doxxing myself by listing by name, but there are a couple chain convenience stores around me that have no-fee ATMs at every location, and it does not matter what bank you personally use.

Frankly, I couldn't care less if there is money changing hands in the background (and neither do the commentors in this thread since that happens everywhere in the world and would be nothing special). The end user pays no fees.

ethereum,"&gt; A complete and total collapse of USDC would take down Maker too, of course

And that's the point OP was making hence ""Dai is wrapped usdc at this point (61% of all dai)"", AKA it is not decentralized if its existence depends on a centralized single point of failure.

&gt; but that's not the usual concern with centralized stablecoins like this. Usually I hear people voicing concern about authorities telling the centralized stablecoin issuer to lock specific wallets for various reasons.

That's *just one* of the concerns, centralized services have several. If DAI can be destroyed by attacking USDC which is easy for governments to do then what's the point, you can just use USDC directly and have the same risk of that happening. DAI was supposed to eliminate that risk by being decentralized and not dependent on any centralized service, it reintroduced it with multicollateral DAI instead which is a shame.

**DAI should have a strict rule not to allow centralized assets as a collateral** as it defeats the purpose it was created for in the first place. Better yet, it should've always stayed with only ETH as a single collateral, what's wrong with that. Multicollateral DAI was a mistake and the reason I'm now reluctant to use it (I've been totally stoked about single collateral DAI).",1626866734,2021-07-21

Besides, reinjecting the need to trust PoA validators into a system that is supposed to be decentralized and favor trustlessness to remove market fears is a complete misunderstanding of the tech and its usefulness. I'd say, get back to your traditional banks if you miss them so much you want PoA.

ethereum,"First, I'd rather that nobody manipulated the market. Saying at least it's Elon Musk and not the state doesn't make it good or excusable.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, that's not actually my point when I say he's bad for crypto. He has some pretty fundamental misunderstandings and he's clearly not putting in the time to learn more. Here are a few examples:

""[Ideally, Doge speeds up block time 10X, increases block size 10X &amp; drops fee 100X. Then it wins hands down.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1393738154889338884)"" There are so many problems with this.  


Vitalik wrote an entire blog post in response to try and explain to Elon the problems with what he was proposing and Elon just replied with ""[He fears the... Doge](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1396698902842122244)"". That's not productive at all and reflects the level of seriousness he's bringing to the table.

&amp;#x200B;

""[BTC &amp; ETH are pursuing a multilayer transaction system, but base layer transaction rate is slow &amp; transaction cost is high. There is merit imo to Doge maximizing base layer transaction rate &amp; minimizing transaction cost with exchanges acting as the de facto secondary layer.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1413396249546563586)"" I can't even...this misses so much about what L2s, DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts in general are. Again, this reflects on how much effort he's putting into learning about this space. He's not a knowledgeable participant in the conversation and he's not shown an interest in becoming one.  


At present the only value he's bringing to the space is as an investor and he doesn't need, nor should he be given, a microphone for doing that.  


If he demonstrates more than a ""LOL Dogecoin Memelord"" kind of attitude, I'm happy to change my opinion on this point; but for the moment I'm sticking to my original statement. **Elon Musk is bad for crypto.**",1626819818,2021-07-21

ethereum,"&gt;You could just do a generic nudity/NSFW detection algorithm then apply facial age in order to flag images that are NSFW and underage. There are state of the art systems that are open source and very accurate.

Not all porn has faces in it, and it'd be trivial to crop out a face even if it was. I remember some dickhead uploading a picture of a man taking a shit on a baby to a forum i used to read. Pretty sure he wasn't aroused by it and posted it to upset everyone, and it was likely not even produced as pornography, but I'm also pretty sure it'd be highly illegal and one of your users uploaded it and then Google indexed it you'd be reported and your servers would be at risk.

&gt;If somehow a false-negative passed through and the government insisted on charging you with a crime despite taking steps to filter that content then you probably need a new government.

They don't need to charge you, they just confiscate your kit for months while they investigate whether you're allowing such stuff on your servers. So a campaign by aggrieved users can bring you down.

&gt;I can understand where you're coming from if Australia's priorities are so out of place that they would waste resources on something that's obviously a parody.

I don't know the background tbh, whether it was automatic, the guy pissed someone off and it was malicious enforcement, or someone snitched to fuck him up, but it went all the way to the high court and he lost.

&gt;Anyway: these laws are intended to regulate personal conduct - not data.If he had printed out those pictures and discarded the files he would have faced the same charges.

Yeah I completely agree, though others could reasonably argue that if no nonconsenting parties are involved or affected then it's not really bad conduct, and people who see their computers as extensions of their mind could compare this to thoughtcrime.",1626819340,2021-07-21

They want to build a closed and centralised block chain, then issue currency like they always have. It would be valued like cash is now and behave like cash, only with far less privacy. I'm not endorsing this, just repeating what I've read. The reasoning behind it is the risk that crypto takes over, their main fear is not decentralised crypto but more from companies like Facebook who would love to replace our cash to gather data about everything we buy. This over time could give Facebook more power then a county's bank. The other reason is that the un-banked would have easier access to electronic payments (not bad really). Also governments could pay benefits or collect tax with less middlemen (good and bad potential).

b) it's just a few months before ETH PoW ends for good.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin is PoW forever. Yeah, they half rewards now and then, but the asic miners are solely racing against that halving. Whether you're reluctant to switch to PoS or not (I'm excited personally, despite some concerns) the suddenness (by which I do NOT mean lack of warning, but the fact that it happens all at once) is adding insult to injury. Knowing there's only a few months left, why would most miners continue mining after significant and intentional profit reduction AND ongoing linear difficulty increase? There really isn't a good answer. The smart choice for Miners loyal to ETH would be to sell hardware NOW, buy ETH with the profit, and prepare for staking. The smart move for disloyal miners at that point would be to move to another coin and mine that before PoW ETH truly dies and there's a giant hash migration. Since mining is still necessary right up until the moment the beacon chain merges and PoS goes active on the mainnet, EIP 1559 kind of creates a liability for those few months (although also does some cool stuff for eth as well). ETH 3368 as I understand is just trying to make that transition smoother. PoW still dies, but miners are less incentivized to just quit while they're ahead.",1626794896,2021-07-20

We're standing by our Developers by giving them a 65% Pay Bump, a 4 Day Work Week, and plenty of PTO, to ensure they aren't worked to death, like every other Game Studio.  


And we're bringing Amazing Stories to the Gaming Community, by literally letting you pick between 3 Amazing Stories, that are ready for Pre-Production.    


I might need to clarify, just for you.....  **Stories in Games are the Singleplayer and Coop Experiences that let you get to know the Universe you're in.**  You might be confused, because almost every AAA Game Studio has dropped Singleplayer, in favor of One-Mode Games that are Multiplayer only.  


We plan on introducing our Layer 2 Blockchain, ERC-821 (where NFTs become Smart), ERC-1255 (ERC20 + ERC821), and a strategy to Commercialize the Blockchain.  We plan on taking over AAA Gaming by competing with Games that actually have their Creator's Heart poured into them.    
The Visionary and CEO (me), will be making **LESS** than the Developers.  We will catch the AAA Studios off guard, and transform Gaming, by giving Players another option, and proving that Blockchain is better for Gaming, by making every item that drops in our Games, sNFTs.  


If you even looked at the Tokenomics, the Initial Team has 10% allocated, and only receives 10% of that, for 4 Years.  The Community (Gamers, Investors, Backers, etc) have 55% allocated.

I'll merit you with a real response:

You could just do a generic nudity/NSFW detection algorithm then apply facial age in order to flag images that are NSFW and underage. There are state of the art systems that are open source and very accurate.

You obviously do not need a database of illegal content to do this.

If somehow a false-negative passed through and the government insisted on charging you with a crime despite taking steps to filter that content then you probably need a new government.

ethereum,"ETH has many great competitors and strong gas fees issues. It needs to overcome those issues while making the whole ecosystem more *dumb-friendly*. 

If you do your own research about sharding, L2, ZK rollup, and so on you can see each of those improvements come with a respectable amount of problems driving down the usability of the system.

I'm not spreading FUD against Ethereum, I own myself a pretty good share of ETH. I'm just questioning if Ethereum will overcome all those problems in time, or if a competitor will take the upper ground.

That's not a question I can answer yet, but that's a fundamental point when asking yourself what is a good store of value. That's why I truly believe BTC as being a better store of value: it has literally no competitors in what it does: storing and retrieving values.   
It serves no other purpose, I don't believe in the lightning network (I believe in wrapped-BTC) nor believe it will grow at the same pace as the whole ecosystem.  But on my risk scale, BTC remains way less risky than Ethereum.

ethereum,"Nuclear Weapon tests are a more plausible cause of climate change than industrial carbon emissions.

The detonation of a nuclear weapon creates a fireball that is many degrees hotter than the sun - this causes the breakdown of ozone molecules. The explosion then creates neutrons that strike the atmosphere causing massive amounts of nitrogen-14 to transform into carbon-14 with a modest half-life of 5,730 years.  
  
After being created in the upper atmosphere, most of the carbon-14 then forms into 14-CarbonMonoxide and 14-CarbonDioxide which diffuse throughout the atmosphere both of which have exceptional thermal capacities. The remaining various radioactive byproducts then react with other atmospheric gases causing further damage to the ozone. With the lack of ozone cosmic radiation then converts more nitrogen-14 into carbon-14 through the same process. The constant nuclear detonations established a self-sustaining ""atmospheric fire"" causing continued release of carbon-14 since the 1960s even without the detonation of nuclear devices.  
  
In the 1950s the first scientific research was published which suggested that the ozone layer was being depleted which led to the banning of nuclear testing in Antarctica in 1963. The ozone hole over Antarctica first appeared when nuclear testing peaked, it was originally thought that the ozone layer would recover within a few years after the cessation of nuclear testing however it still remains depleted today.  
  
Between the United States and Russia, over 2,600 nuclear devices were detonated: each one releasing immeasurable amounts of carbon-14. The final nuclear test by the United States took place on September 23, 1992 and the final test by the Soviet Union occurred on October 24, 1990; however it would be relatively easy for the United States, Russia, or a another nation to resume nuclear testing and there is a real risk that additional detonations could rapidly intensify climate change.  
  
According to SmarterChild the only practical way to clean the atmosphere in the short-term is probably reducing the amount of carbon-14 by converting some of it into carbon-13 with the use of high-powered lasers.",1626779824,2021-07-20

* If you run or create any kind of platform that allows users to upload images and share them, then unless you send every image to Microsoft, then you risk getting your door kicked in and your servers seized.
* If you use this service heavily then you must pay a license fee, essentially regulatory capture that levies a tax on every image sharing service and ISP, forcing them to be for-profit or sell user data.
* We are not allowed to know how the images are fingerprinted, or to have a list of illegal fingerprints. The process is secret and takes complete images in order to prevent ban evasion.
* As part of the license terms, you're not allowed to say ""this image is illegal"", you have to quietly censor it. So it forces dishonesty by providers.
* We're not allowed to possess or view this highly illegal data, so we can't actually verify whether it's actually illegal or we are being lied to.
* ""Non photographic child abuse images"" (e.g. illegal artwork) are also flagged, and there's at least one case of an Australian being prosecuted for possession of a GIF depicting The Simpsons having an orgy. Distasteful, shocking, obscene art that isn't actually child abuse can detected and reported by the filters.
* The effect of uploading every image to Microsoft's PhotoDNA service is they are also sent via American military intelligence (NSA). So classified photographs and documents can be hashed by the US and allied militaries and detected in real-time as they are shared on any platform on the web, as well as them passively getting a copy of every image of every person or document ever published. We'll never know how American military contracts have been won by industrial espionage that this enables, or how many scandals have been contained thanks to early warning systems here.
* Because local ISPs in oppressive regimes also use the service to fingerprint and filter images, it's likely had a chilling effect on whistleblowing worldwide. We'll never know how much corruption went unchecked, how many journalistic sources were outed, how many real rapes and murders were covered up, or elections were stolen. But I bet it's nonzero.
* Independent researchers can't create new novel ways to preemptively detect and block CP because the training sets are illegal and the metadata is secret, this must be done under special license by authorized people (Microsoft); innovation in this area is impossible.

You might think that these issues are a reasonable compromise given the alternative, but it's pretty uncharitable to dismiss people who disagree as paedos or cognitively rigid.

Bitcoin is the store of value de facto, simply because everybody agreed upon it. This will not change, because changing it would create a trust issue in the market. 

If Bitcoin cannot be the store of value, why any other coin could be safe ?

There is no technical issue with bitcoin if you consider it as gold-reserve. 7tx/s is perfectly fine if you transfer a large amount of value between institutions and wealthy people. 

The BTC market cap will stay around 10% of the total market cap of the industry, so there is more money to make with other coins for sure.

Ethereum is riskier because the value comes from the tech, and there are many competitors which are or will be ahead of it. 

Currently, it has the first-mover advantage, but nobody can tell if it will be enough.

ethereum,"Literally every single one of your arguments has been in a strawman. Either you‚Äôre dense and are incapable of comprehending my argument, or you‚Äôre purposely misrepresenting them in bad faith. 

Did you even read my quote? It explains the logic of the argument: ‚Äúunlimited tolerance should be preferred, but there are cases where intolerant philosophies will use misinformation and violence to uphold their power, at which point, there should be persecution of the intolerant instead of indifference‚Äù. Popper‚Äôs argument is sound because speech being uttered by those who use violence/threats and misinformation to discredit other speech is going to push out the victims of that intolerance. Just saying ‚Äúno you‚Äôre wrong, Popper‚Äôs wrong too‚Äù isn‚Äôt even a logical argument. You sound like an idiot.  

Black and white posturing as things as free and authoritarian is not the way the world works. It‚Äôs also meaningless and stupid. My point is the government literally bans certain type of speech. Certain types of speech aren‚Äôt constitutionally protected, and you can be prosecuted for that. Obscenity (not consensual porn, but things like rape, child porn, revenge porn, etc) is just one of those categories. 

‚ÄúCategories of speech that are given lesser or no protection by the First Amendment (and therefore may be restricted) include obscenity, fraud, child pornography, speech integral to illegal conduct, speech that incites imminent lawless action, speech that violates intellectual property law, true threats, and commercial speech such as advertising. Defamation that causes harm to reputation is a tort and also an exception to free [speech](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions).‚Äù 

A legal system is going to need to have the ability to remove this illegal speech from public spaces. Call me authoritarian if you want but if my daughter‚Äôs pedophile gym coach took a photo of her in the locker room and posted it online, I would want that taken down. Or if the locations of all of those in the Witness Protection Program. Or the address of a very unpopular social activist. In person or in print the government can restrict that by punishing those publishing the speech and shutting down publication. Online they can by the use of gag orders/subpoenas. You can subpoena companies with non-immutable servers. How do you subpoena a ‚Äúdecentralized immutable social media‚Äù? The fact you can‚Äôt AND the fact that it would be easily seen by the general public (in a public space) means the government is going to view it as a national security risk. 

Breathe in the copium all you want, but a popular decentralized social media is going to need some moderation built in, it‚Äôs going to happen. At that point, you might even end up with decentralized content moderation all over again.",1626768251,2021-07-20

ethereum,"&gt; given to turn holders

What do you mean by ""turn holders""?

See the section ""Protocol fees"". Apologies since this is V2, but I believe V3 has similar tokenomics.
https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/advanced-topics/fees/

&gt; At the moment there are no protocol fees. However, it is possible for a 0.05% fee to be turned on in the future.

&gt; To open a path to self-sustainability, the code for Uniswap V2 includes a small protocol charge mechanism. At launch, the protocol charge will default to 0, and the liquidity provider fee will be 0.30%. If the protocol charge is switched on, it will become 0.05% and the liquidity provider fee will be 0.25%.

&gt; This feature, including the exact percentage amounts, is hardcoded into the core contracts which remain decentralized and non-upgradable. It can be turned on, and directed by, a decentralized governance process deployed after the Uniswap V2 launch. There is no expectation that it will be turned on in the near future but it opens the possibility for future exploration.",1626755631,2021-07-20

So I'd predict that what would happen is you would have some hardline free speech portals that pop up and say ""we filter NOTHING!"" along with some portals that only filter illegal content, maybe some portals that filter all sexual content of any kind, etc etc etc. Maybe there would be portals for veterans that filter PTSD-type triggering content, I don't know.

ethereum,"I looked it up:


4.1. Cash Withdrawals
If you have a bank card (carte bancaire) then you are able to withdraw money free of charge at any cash dispenser with the CB logo.

The ATMs are called distributeurs automatiques de billets (DAB)/guichet automatique.

There are limits on how much you can withdraw in any single occasion, or over 7/30 days, depending on your type of card and the limit set by your bank.

If you exceed your limit on your card, you can withdraw money from your bank, or from any other bank, by cheque.

You do not need your own cheque book to withdraw from your own bank, as they can prepare an omnibus cheque from within the branch that you merely need to sign.

If you have not exceeded your cash limit you can also withdraw cash from another bank by using your cash card at the counter. A charge may be payable and some form of identity will be required.

You will receive a receipt for the withdrawal, which you should retain until you have checked it against your bank statement.

Increasingly, local branches do not hold any cash behind the counter.

The only way to withdraw cash is from the cash dispenser.

If you do not have you card available then you will need to complete a withdrawal slip at the counter.

You will then be supplied with a card to enter into the cash dispenser to receive your cash.

You will not need to enter any code or amount as the card will be programmed to dispense your cash. The card will also be retained by the cash dispenser.

If you withdraw money from a cash dispenser using a French bank card within the Eurozone then no charges are payable.

Outside of the Eurozone withdrawing money from a cash dispenser does incur a currency exchange charge, which may be proportional and/or fixed (eg 2.5% + ‚Ç¨3), depending on the terms of your contract.

In isolated rural areas, where cash dispensers may not be readily available, some banks have arrangements with local shops - butchers, bakers, tabacs, etc - that enable you to obtain a cash withdrawal through the shop. The largest of these networks is with Credit Agricole, with the service called 'Point Vert'.

Since 2018 French retailers have also been formally authorised to offer 'cashback' in their shops",1626725330,2021-07-20

You probably end up with a system where no new users can participate after your initial intake because it's too hard to gain a rating or compete with rated users. The only alternative is to set the system up so new users aren't so disadvantaged, but that allows people to set up multiple accounts to mask / carry out malicious activity.

Either way you are never going to be as effective as something that has the backing of an existing nation state or powerful private corporation. Given nation states are far more rationale ultimately than private corporations as they are not beholden to the profit motive they seem our best bet.

ethereum,"I'm sorry, but you are the one who doesn't seem to understand the nature of decentralization.  ""de"" is a prefix that means ""not"" and ""centralization"" is ""the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision-making, framing strategy and policies become concentrated within a particular group.""

Decentralization literally does mean that each individual or organization can decide how much they wish to collaborate or integrate with others.  So, yes, it means that within the new group people get to decide what goes on.  Consensus mechanisms exist to help those decentralized groups operate - when consensus breaks down the groups either have to work out their differences or split into smaller decentralized groups.

Now, we live in a world where power is exerted by groups to impose rules that they believe must be followed.  Sometimes, I agree with those rules.  For instance, I'd be happy to belong to a group that persecutes child predators and people who drive slow in the left lane.  That is a compromise of the ideals of letting people do what they want - but one that I am happy to live with.

However, it seems that you want to punish people who say things that you disagree with.  You specifically cite ""horrible alt right groups"" as the people that you want to persecute, so I have some assumptions about your political persuasion.  That's fine, you do you, but don't lecture me on ""decentralization"" when you don't seem to understand what it is.",1626721221,2021-07-20

ethereum,"you‚Äôre making the strawman by calling me an authoritarian for wanting those things gone. all I ever said was there be a mechanism for the removal of illegal speech from decentralized social media, and for some reason that makes me an authoritarian. do you even know what a strawman is? me calling you out for calling me an authoritarian for wanting child porn off the internet is not a strawman because that‚Äôs exactly what you said word for word. you even called it ‚Äúmoral masturbation‚Äù hahaha jesus now that I‚Äôm thinking about it you do sound like a pedophile",1626711735,2021-07-20
ethereum,"It is illegal speech. By definition. The official term given by the court is ""unprotected speech"".

""[In general, content-based restrictions on speech](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/IF11072.pdf)‚Äîlaws that ‚Äúappl\[y\] to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed‚Äù‚Äîare presumptively unconstitutional and subject to strict scrutiny. Reed, 135 S. Ct. at 2226-27. However, the Supreme Court has recognized limited categories of speech that the government may regulate because of their content, as long as it does so evenhandedly. See R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 382-86 (1992). The Court generally identifies these categories as obscenity, defamation, fraud, incitement, fighting words, true threats, speech integral to criminal conduct, and child pornography.""

Hate speech is strictly defined to being violating if it falls under those categories. So yes calling someone a ""ni\*\*\*r"" on the Internet is allowed, but if you paired the ""ni\*\*\*r"" with ""all black people should die because they're inferior and slowing down the human race"" and then posted a picture of a gun with the words ""Negro-killer"" on it, then you're falling into true threats, incitement territory, which would then be prosecuted as a hate crime, or incitement to hate crime or something. Or if you were leaving a bar and called a black person on the street a ""nig\*\*r"" and then he starts running at you and then you shoot him in ""self-defense"", you're probably still going to jail because you incited the fight with ""fighting words"".

There is no Mussolini level of suppression here, because for long before you were ver born, courts have been tackling the issue of how to regulate speech that harms others. Hate speech is disallowed if it falls under these categories, and even when not, tends to have less de-facto protections than traditional speech (lots of judges aren't favorable to defendants who have participated in hate speech during crimes, even if it's legal).",1626711239,2021-07-20

ethereum,"Why do so many of you types just take things out of context and act like that proves you right? Popper‚Äôs argument doesn‚Äôt just stop there lmao, and hate speech isn‚Äôt necessarily something that can just be countered with traditional speech. How about you copy and paste in the REST of Popper‚Äôs argument instead of being disingenuous and arguing in bad faith? This is from Open Society and Enemies, literally from the part RIGHT AFTER you ended your quote:

‚ÄúIn this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. 

But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.‚Äù

How about that? Did you read that? Or did you just pick and choose your argument because you assumed I don‚Äôt read what I talk about? I understand Popper was discussing Plato‚Äôs defense of ‚Äúbenevolent despotism‚Äù, but he was disagreeing with it. He was arguing liberal democracies with strong institutions (like the law) can hold strong against and punish the intolerant that refuse to accept being called out. He DOES NOT claim an extra judicial censorship of speech, which is why I‚Äôve been saying this whole time that social media should censor illegal speech. Hate speech, obscenity, confidential information, incitement of violence, fraud, IP-violating speech, etc. all aren‚Äôt protected speech by the way (depends on context but usually it‚Äôs not). All I‚Äôm saying is within the American legal framework those types of speech are illegal and our society as a whole have decided they‚Äôre bad for the public, which is why they‚Äôre not protected. 

Literally all of you types see the world as black and white, and fail to understand the need for nuance in anything, and the moment someone calls you out on it, you label that person as an authoritarian or whatever. That‚Äôs why the majority of the world disagrees with your political view, because no one overarching ideology can apply perfectly to any system.",1626708214,2021-07-19

 &gt;The iron law of oligarchy is a political theory first developed by the German-born Italian sociologist Robert Michels in his 1911 book, Political Parties. It asserts that rule by an elite, or oligarchy, is inevitable as an ""iron law"" within any democratic organization as part of the ""tactical and technical necessities"" of organization. Michels's theory states that all complex organizations, regardless of how democratic they are when started, eventually develop into oligarchies.

That would make it so that moving from one network to another is a seamless as driving across a state border within the US or EU.

Government already has the ability to do this. For example, CP is usually traded over the decentralized Bittorrent protocol. Guess what? Assholes who trade in CP still get caught and convicted.

&gt; If they don‚Äôt, then the tech used to put forth the speech is dangerous to civilization.

Christ, get over yourself.

&gt; Just look at the paradox of tolerance by karl popper. It‚Äôs a philosophical argument that explains why hate speech needs to be excluded.

That is not what the paradox of tolerance says at all, which I hasten to add, Popper did not invent (he was discussing Plato's advocacy of an autocracy). I recommend that you actually read *The Open Society and Its Enemies* rather than just picking up what you saw on tumblr. You would have read him write, for example, ""I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, **suppression would certainly be most unwise.**"" (emphasis added because you obviously need it). Of course, Popper was not Yoda but how about not claiming to read things that you have not?

Also, consider that the society that claims to stamp out intolerance is itself intolerant and therefore unjust.

Before you read Popper, perhaps you should read J. S. Mill's *On Liberty* although I suspect it would not affect your tyrannical views.",1626667709,2021-07-19
ethereum,"&gt; it‚Äôs not just Nazis, there‚Äôs tons of information that‚Äôs privileged in our world that a decentralized social media destroys.

... what?

&gt; How do you have privacy at all with a decentralized social media with no content moderation?

Who said it wouldn't have content moderation?

Privacy is tricky insofar as your friends' servers might recieve your data if you have a private profile, and your friends might choose untrustworthy servers. I'm not sure how you'd have to design the network's privacy model to get around that, but I also generally think people need to stop pretending their social media are ever going to involve privacy.

&gt; Anyone‚Äôs information whether it be corporate secrets or personal info would no longer be private.

If you share any of those on social media, they never were private. Decentralization changes very little of that.

&gt; I think decentralized social media is a fantasy. Even if you have a decentralized governance entity that does the content moderation, that‚Äôs still at risk of having all powerful ‚Äúbad mods‚Äù taking over, like reddit for example. You would also still have the pedophiles and Nazi complaining about censorship.

I don't think you read my comment. Have you heard of the Fediverse? Did you look it up?

It's not decentralized governance of a centralized social network, it's a decentralized network. It's a network run on multiple servers by different moderators with different moderation policies. If you get banned from mastodon.social, you can move to... writing.exchange, or start your own node. Each node does its own moderation, and if your node doesn't moderate well, other nodes will defederate with you.

Nazis will always whine. This is not meant to prevent nazis from being whiny little bitches.

Aside from the obvious issues like illegal content and scaring normies away with edgy content, there are less obvious problems such as bad actors wreaking all kinds of havoc that make a platform unusable (mainly spam) if they aren't aggressively banned. (And you can't address this by simply charging people to post without making it prohibitively expensive to use the site honestly).

In the face of censorship by companies like Twitter and FB, it's understandable that the reaction would be calling for completely unregulated platforms, but that overly-simplistic approach doesn't work either.

What we really need is something like Reddit before Yishan was replaced by Pao, where they had a good balance of decentralization and centralization - the subreddit jannies could largely decide their own rules but you also had a (minimally) centralized admin branch of government dealing with dedicated bad actors like spam bots, illegal content, and the like.

ethereum,"But you do realize that all of those examples I listed above were at first vilified and dismissed as nonsense conspiracy theories right? The evolution of acceptance went from sheer blasphemy -&gt; eventual truth. Instantly labelling something a conspiracy is highly anti-intellectual because it dismisses evidence  and examination of facts and instead just automatically deems something untrue.

I'm not necessarily suggesting that the issues you listed are real conspiracies, but it's possible that some of them have some truths to them, while others don't. Again, it's about not immediately dismissing and labelling an idea and instead intellectually analyzing it to demolish it with better ideas. More discussion about it is encouraged to eventually arrive at the truth.

Another important factor that you're not taking into account is state propaganda and intentional disinformation in order to further a state's agenda. Manipulation is a real tactic, accepting everything as-is just because the government or the mainstream media says so is silly and naive.

ethereum,"Sorry for the late reply-- and I can only offer my perspective here, but this is what I think makes sense:

The cost of purchasing ETH is always fair, no matter what. If it rises to be $100,000 it's because that is what it is worth (in comparison to the USD). The thing that I don't think you're accounting for is that ETH is more or less a speculative asset right now (it's more of an investment than a true store of value). If ETH gets to be $100k, people will be purchasing it with more confidence than they are right now because it will have really started to approach its potential (based on speculation at first and then later by truly providing the value it strives to deliver). It will likely be that ETH is a lot more stable in another 15 years and the level of risk involved in purchasing it will be MUCH lower. So, if someone is purchasing today at $2k and another person is purchasing in 15 years at $100k, it is very fair because that person that bought today was taking on a lot more risk than the person in 2036.",1626623030,2021-07-18

There can be many things that change the quantity of gas a smart contract consumes. But in any of the ways I know, it's always either that the smart contract author didn't ask for enough gas or didn't send enough gas to at least one of the smart contracts it calls, for at least one possible branching (let's say, outcome) of the transaction execution. Some branching may be more complex than others and, as such, requiring more gas, which should be asked by the smart contract for the transaction to occur without error.

In short, I don't think you did anything wrong. It's most probably a Coinbase problem or the problem of one of the dependencies of this smart contract.

One correction though, poor people can access '*securities*' - with minimal restrictions other than the structural and KYC ones I noted. But I get your meaning.

It's worth noting though, that at least in that summary of the Dodd-Frank law you linked, it says:

""accredited investor standards are used in determining the availability of certain exemptions from Securities Act registration for *nonpublic* and *limited offerings*, including most offerings under Regulation D.""

Emphases mine. I tried to find ""Regulation D"", but gave up on mobile PDF. But presumably that is stuff that you or I would never have had access to anyway, or at least I surely never would have wanted to. (Individual public stocks, bond funds, and ETFs are as exotic as I get.) 

I do know that that bill was intended to prevent some of the worst excesses and manipulation of the powerful, not screw the poor. The literal opposite of what we're talking about.

Just spinning up a million nodes or something won't actually make the change happen. Nodes being relevant in fork decisions only come into play when the miners can't come to a decision. And even then, it's not a complete consensus but rather just drawing the lines between the two sides. It's also basic game theory that people will tend to the majority unless they have some strong driving opinion that pushes them against the current. At the end of all this you'll probably have two chains but the nodes themselves will probably be the deciding factor in which chain is the majority and which is the minority. 

If the authoritative individuals in a network (i.e. Miners) can't come to a decision, it's up to the people (the users/nodes) to pick a side. At this point it's a primarily social rather than algorithmic decision making process.",1626543470,2021-07-18

ethereum,"It is though and it doesn't pose the threat of a sybil attack because sybil attacks only apply for authorities in a network.

Nodes aren't authorities in the network because nodes have no trust in each other. You have to have trust in staking nodes or miners in a network because they have authority in the network and can misuse said trust. With no trust there's no threat for a normal node so you can host as many as you want.

Nodes make the ""roads"" in the network. The miners simply distribute the Tx over those roads. The paths of the roads dynamically reconfigure as nodes join and leave the network. When miners are split on a fork decision, the nodes pick a side and the paths redraw to exclude nodes running a now incompatible protocol. You can go out of your way to stick with the losing side but most rational actors on the network will side with the winning side unless they have some strong opinion about the decision.

At the end of the day if the miners are tied, the ""true"" chain ends up being the one that more users side with and more likely than not the winner will end up siphoning hash power from the losing side as a result.

ethereum,"You're confusing mining rigs and pools with nodes. From [https://braiins.com/blog/bitcoin-nodes-vs-miners-demystified:](https://braiins.com/blog/bitcoin-nodes-vs-miners-demystified:)

&gt;Unlike mining, running a bitcoin node is not very costly (it‚Äôs typically in the $150-400 range). However, nodes are equally if not more important than miners in achieving decentralization. The roles of nodes are to:  
Validate transactions  
Keep a historic record of transactions  
**Dictate and enforce the rules of the network.**  
&gt;  
&gt;In simple terms, nodes ensure that everybody ‚Äî from miners to users and other nodes ‚Äî plays by the rules. This can be done out of self-interest. Each user, wallet, company, mining pool, and exchange that runs a node is doing so in part to ensure they are not being cheated. Everyone running a node carries a copy of the blockchain and is responsible for maintaining and updating their copy.   
As transactions are propagated and confirmed, node operators are validating that these transactions meet the rules of the network. If a user receives a transaction that creates 1,000,000 bitcoin out of thin air, the user (and all other nodes on the network) will reject the transaction. If any invalid transaction somehow makes it into a block, all the nodes will reject the entire block and wait for another to be mined which doesn‚Äôt contain any invalid transactions.  
Bitcoin is based on consensus. **All nodes are in agreement to the rules of the network and the state of the blockchain, and will ignore anybody who is misaligned.** 

Nodes who support the upcoming Taproot upgrade ""voted"" by upgrading their Bitcoin core version. Their consensus would have overridden miners' votes had the latter decided to reject it.",1626530477,2021-07-17

ethereum,"&gt;many dApp teams simply ran their own indexing.

So the argument you are trying to make is that there was no difference between pre- and post- The Graph with regard to ease of indexing Ethereum's chain data? Be real, it took dApps months-years to build their own indexes and was a huge time sink and waste of resources/manpower. The reason dApps were able to be built so quickly in 2019 and onward was because the chain data was indexed by The Graph and made it easier for developers to make subgraphs using The Graph's data.

Developers were certainly able to build their own indexes prior to The Graph, but the reason most have stopped and instead now use The Graph is because it was bulky, inconvenient, and a waste of resources to do it on their own.  The Graph's usability and applicability was so powerful that even Solana, Avalanche, Matic *reached out* to The Graph and *requested* support. The Graph didn't ask these chains if they want to be indexed, the chains *sought out The Graph*.

I appreciate someone finally trying to give me a well-thought out argument, but it doesn't make a great case. It's really this simple: we didn't see many functioning or actively used dApps before The Graph was launched, and we saw tons of lending protocols and decentralized exchanges created after The Graph was launched.",1626521425,2021-07-17

We saw this in bitcoin during the scaling debate, where the default option to not come to an agreement is simply to not come to an agreement and keep the status quo. The difficulty bomb makes it necessarry to make a concious decision about things, and keeping the status quo is not simply doing nothing but  a decision that fe requires a delay of the bomb.  
The problem is probably less apparent with london since everyone agrees on the change and pools dont really have the option to not run it. They reason why I said that london is not in their interest is that they would lose a lot of revenue by transaction fees now that the base fee is burned. So the bomb is probably not enough of a warant on its own but it plays nice into things altogether.  
The real possibility is the direct reason why the bomb exists, that miners will simply keep on mining on the old chain since they've got nothing to lose as soon as the switch to PoS happenes. They would have to make a concious decision to push their own version of geth with a disabled difficulty bomb and agree on the direction of this PoW fork.",1626518105,2021-07-17

ethereum,"[https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/06/pos2020.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/06/pos2020.html)

&gt; In the PoS case, however, things are much brighter. For certain kinds of 51% attacks (particularly, reverting finalized blocks), there is a built-in ""slashing"" mechanism in the proof of stake consensus by which a large portion of the attacker's stake (and no one else's stake) can get automatically destroyed. For other, harder-to-detect attacks (notably, a 51% coalition censoring everyone else), the community can coordinate on a minority user-activated soft fork (UASF) in which the attacker's funds are once again largely destroyed (in Ethereum, this is done via the ""inactivity leak mechanism""). No explicit ""hard fork to delete coins"" is required; with the exception of the requirement to coordinate on the UASF to select a minority block, everything else is automated and simply following the execution of the protocol rules.

&gt;Hence, attacking the chain the first time will cost the attacker many millions of dollars, and the community will be back on their feet within days. Attacking the chain the second time will still cost the attacker many millions of dollars, as they would need to buy new coins to replace their old coins that were burned. And the third time will... cost even more millions of dollars. The game is very asymmetric, and not in the attacker's favor.",1626516358,2021-07-17

ethereum,"From 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' by Hunter S. Thompson:

‚ÄúThe only thing that really worried me was the   
ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and  
 depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge. And I knew we'd   
get into that rotten stuff pretty soon. Probably at the next gas   
station.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is the main advantage of ether: it makes you  
 behave like the village drunkard in some early Irish novel... total   
loss of all basic motor skills: Blurred vision, no balance, numb tongue -  
 severance of all connection between the body and the brain. Which is   
interesting, because the brain continues to function more or less   
normally... you can actually watch yourself behaving in the terrible   
way, but you can't control it.‚Äù",1626507759,2021-07-17

You also have decentralized storage, like what Gitcoin does (which does the same as The Graph, but for storage). 

The principle behind all three of these services is to enable an off-chain service (which is generally more efficient than running computation on-chain) to be provided through a decentralized on-chain marketplace managing the conflicts that may arise during on-chain transactions, ensuring any malevolent behavior (like providing a false index, poor CGI results or corrupted stored data) is counterproductive for the ill-intended market actor.

Now, right-wing and hyper capitalistic are expressions that encompass huge bunches of meanings, some of them contradicting each others. So, it's pretty hard to disprove such unclear statement. 

And I suspect it precisely was the goal: to make sure the statement is unclear enough so that it can't easily be debunked. Some people like to do that in order to avoid any valid counter-argument without having to think of an actual, solid claim. 

Anyway, one thing is certain: the Ethereum community has proven its will to make sure people can interact in a peer-to-peer way, without trying to enforce rules at the expense of everyone else, and letting anyone willing to do differently do so.

This can be seen as hyper capitalistic in the sense of letting people trade between each others, which is the best we can take from all the meanings people out behind capitalism. And it is the opposite of any authoritarianism that some people put behind right-wing agendas.",1626502264,2021-07-17

ethereum,"&gt; How could they have total control over the network? If majority of the nodes run the new software with the changes, then it's because the nodes decided on doing that.

Because they carry the inertia of the default choice.  Again: changes they want to put into the clients (and thus make the default implementation) cannot be opposed save for a supermajority of users *rejecting* that change by not upgrading (and turning off automatic upgrades, if they have them on)--or worse yet, are forced to coordinate a different fork that lacks the offending change.

Many people running a node are using it as a means to an end (using the network), and not because they particularly care in partaking in consensus or governance. Not all of them are actively choosing to accept the changes; they're simply picking the side of the fork most likely to win.

Forcing nodes to opt *into* governance by requiring them to take affirmative action *in support of* a new feature means that all users who do not have a preference are an implicit vote *against* said feature.  Forcing users to opt *out of* governance by requiring them to take affirmative action if they *do not want* a new feature means all users who do not have a preference are an implicit vote *in favor* of said feature.

It's worth noting that the opt-out approach incentivizes apathy towards governance. This creates a self-reinforcing system in which whomever controls the defaults has more or less total control over the network.  The more people who don't care, the more implicit votes there are in favor of the defaults.  The more votes there are in favor of the defaults, the less people care about governance, because having an opinion on the matter is decreasingly likely to have an actual impact on the outcome.

Remember: The most contention fork in Ethereum's history only managed a meager voter turnout of 5-15%.  That means up to 95% of the network had no opinion and would simply follow whatever was the default option.  To say that there was ""community consensus"" under these conditions is laughable.

&gt; But in addition to node choosing which software to run, does the difficulty bomb need to be diffused in order for the chain split to even work?

To some degree, yes.  This introduces a coordination game that's heavily rigged in the existing developers' favor, though.",1626496596,2021-07-17

As for the rest of us that own crypto, I believe eth will rise in value above eth 2.0 because of the burning of it from each transaction. But that‚Äôs an uneducated assumption. All I know is if people want to all effect the price of crypto going up (more we buy the more it rises) then they need to get off of Robinhood.

Unlike cryptocurrency, which requires all tokens to be identical, each NFT is unique or limited in quantity.

ethereum,"The Altair upgrade ups the ante on validator responsibilities. 

Currently, fully inactive validators lose roughly 11.8% of their staked ether balance. After the upgrade, they‚Äôll lose about 15.4%. In addition, validators who are slashed by the network for malicious behavior such as double-signing or double-proposing blocks will get fined 0.5 ETH after hard fork activation instead of 0.25 ETH.


The Altair upgrade also corrects a slight imbalance in the distribution of rewards. The vast majority of earnings for validators comes from votes and attestations of the correct block. Only 3% of overall rewards is earned from proposing the next block in the Eth 2.0 Beacon chain. 

After Altair, block proposal rewards will jump up to about 12.5% of overall validator rewards so that the earnings for different validator responsibilities becomes more evenly split. 

&gt;Altair is considered a ‚Äúwarm-up upgrade‚Äù meant to prepare Eth 2.0 protocol developers for a much higher-stakes upgrade upcoming later this year or early next. This latter upgrade expected to follow Altair will permanently fuse the Ethereum blockchain with the Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain and fully transition Ethereum to a PoS protocol.

ethereum,"Its not just necessarily reverting hacks. If there is a rapid drop in the price of a uniswap pair, if the volume of the pair is high enough it could be economically viable for an MEV arb to pay miners to go back several blocks to insert themselves into trades that are guaranteed to be profitable. Likely many bots can see the same opportunity and will bid against each other so most of the value here will go to the miners, which will encourage them to take up the offer. For example if there's a guaranteed $1M to be made on arbing a trade across a few blocks, it would make sense for the bot to pay miners $900K so they can pocket the other $100K. The average block reward is \~$4K or so right now so it is much much more lucrative for miners to roll back the chain rather than extend it. There just hasn't been a reliable public mechanism to propose those bounties, but at this point it looks to be only a matter of time. Then it's just up to the big pools to refuse to engage with those bounties, but if enough smaller pools do, and miners leave for those smaller pools, the big pools might shrug and join - just like they did with single block MEV. 

The traditional argument has always been that reorgs are so damaging to the chain that they will tank the price of ETH and miners don't want that, but the impending merge removes that constraint because they will have less and less left to lose as it comes closer. It's only a matter of time now.",1626361508,2021-07-15

It looks like these people want that juicy attention - that's why they came up with all these weird flashy names for the old issues.

Assuming you can create a contract that drops a bounty from the stolen funds for each reverted block, you again don't need to bother with any convoluted strategies. Just send ETH to the exchange, buy other coin, withdraw it, and then drop a bounty on the ETH deposit reversal. That's it. No effort required.

And the basefee is just a mechanism to determine how much users are willing to pay to get their transactions included. Combined with the dynamic block size it should guarantee your transaction gets included (most of the time), as long as you pay the base fee + a small tip, without the need to overbid.",1626339501,2021-07-15

The security model is considered broken if any single entity have 51% of entire hashing power, so what are we even talking about???

&gt; ""Rental attacks"" are feasible using cloud resources, particularly for systems such as Ethereum that rely heavily on GPUs, which are standard cloud commodities. Sites such as http://crypto51.app/ estimate the costs.

If you could just rent 51% of hashing power, why would you engage in some stupidly complex MEV scheme??? You send ETH to the centralized exchange, purchase Monero or any other crypto) withdraw Monero to your address, rewind the ETH Blockchain. Rinse and repeat.

I am talking about the case where the miners will reject all txns without a tip.  If enough miners do this, and it seems possible since they lose nothing, it will condition users to include a tip.  At that point, how is that diff than what we are doing today?  And if so, what is the purpose of 1559?  Where it the fee predictability within the block?",1626333214,2021-07-15

ethereum,"I think it is very likely that it will happen at block 12965000, especially since geth has already released a new version that implements the fork at that block. However the timing is a little bit more difficult to predict. 

If the average blocktime until the 5th is at most 13.37 seconds, then the fork will be implemented on time for the bet. This seems very achievable considering that on average the blocktime has been around 13.2 seconds for the past months. Assuming that the average blocktime will stay the same, this would result in the fork happening around 17.30 on August the 4th. 

The only complicating factor is the looming difficulty bomb. The bomb has the potential of exponentially increasing blocktimes every 100000 blocks. However, up to a certain point the effects of the bomb are cancelled out by the difficulty adjustment mechanism. If you look at prior occurrences, it seems like the bomb only starts slightly increasing blocktimes when it has increased the difficulty by \~5%.

The last difficulty increase by the bomb happened at block 12800000 (July 10). The difficulty increase was around 2% (formula: [https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/245#issuecomment-821329468](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/245#issuecomment-821329468)) , so it should have been cancelled out. If you look at the blocktimes chart that does appear to be the case (today looks like an outlier).

The bomb will only cause one more difficulty increase before the fork. This will happen at block 12900000 (July 25). Assuming that the hashrate stays similar this will result in a difficulty increase of around 4.2%. So this should also be cancelled out. However it is getting closer to the threshold, so assuming some inaccuracy in the calculations, it might cause a very small increase in average blocktimes, though probably not more than 0.1 seconds.

So it seems that it will likely happen before the 5th, however the prediction market odds are currently only 10% for it happening on time. Looks like a great bet",1626281366,2021-07-15

My brain is mush and cannot add anything else of value except by saying that I believe Bitcoin, and to an extent, ethereum, have continued to go up in price (and might still continue to do so) in large part because of their first mover advantages. 

They WERE groundbreaking during their early stages, but now that no longer seems to be the case, especially for BTC.

There is no doubt that Etherum has value at the moment especially as the flourishing DeFi space and Dapps are built on Ethereum, but the jury is still out as to whether they will become the Apple, Google, or Amazon of the crypto world - not just in terms of market cap but in actual solid utility and mass adoption.

I am also on the fence regarding the short-term price action of ETH come EIP1559 (assuming it's not delayed), but as the old adage goes - it might be a case of ""buy the rumor, sell the news"".

ethereum,"I think we've seen something pretty unique, during these past two months. 

If you look at the ETH price in BTC (for instance in coinmarketcap), there's been a 100% increase in something between May and July, with a lot of pressure to buy ETH in exchange for BTC. And we could feel some sort of flipening effect, back then. It was big. 

Then, not long ago, the pressure suddenly stopped and some big whale was reported moving their ETH funds out of some CeFi platform. 

So, to me, what we've observed is one or more big BTC holder(s) slowly converting their funds into ETH, probably believing the next few months would be deeply transformative for the Ethereum network in comparison to the Bitcoin network's slow pace.

I think it was an interesting move, because if other whales follow suit, they will have to follow with a bigger trading cost or wait longer for the buy pressure to cool off, all while knowing there will be a period when it will be too late to wait.

I'd expect some other whales to follow and the buy pressure to come back, at least once they realize the effects of the August EIP and the certainty of getting the formidable consequences of PoS, so between August and December. 

Like the gold rush, except that it will be the fuel rush.

That said, development is always full of surprise and drama, so I also expect wild uncertainty at some point along the way.

Once all the steps you've mentioned have been done the traditional way, and the last step is simply the sale/transfer of the deed - even if that step alone is incorporated into the Ethereum chain, that will be a big step forward and could have good further use-cases and implications for Ethereum. 

For instance, if property sales are on the blockchain (much like NFTs), price discovery, real estate valuations, and taxation would be much easier.

Not everyone is attacking, there can be simple back and forths with simple misinterpretations or misunderstandings. It is the internet, not a face to face conversation. On top of that, the assumptions that I am not understanding the hash rate at a fundamental level is also unfounded. Calm yourself.


It is true that the current hashrate is a result of many variables in action, but the financial return is easily the most important, which inturn has its own set of variables. Reducing a aspect of the reward by half will impact revenue if price doesn't react accordingly. Because at that moment, the system you defined will have equalized and either the price increases or there needs to be another equalization period of lower profitable miners leaving due to costs and the hash rate reducing.


I do agree that to back this concern evidence would be helpful, but I do not think is necessary. The block reward has been the primary incentive to mine. If that removes a new incentive needs to take its place assuming price doesn't increase to a staggering amount.

ethereum,"Ad absurdum


I agree there needs to be some stability to a currency, but the technical advancements is what I care most about Ethereum. Of course every modification suggested and made needs a high level of scrutiny and that occurs. I wasn't suggesting there was ""direct-to-prod"" modifications being made. Only that the devs do not shy away from making changes. This is a technology at its root, not a currency and as the ecosystem changes (the absurd requirements of PoW), the technology should adapt accordingly (a reduced feature set for a quicker release of PoS)


In your previous, you are correct with L2/L2 advancements and that should be considered in my original post. I agree with that completely.


I still disagree with the hash rate logic. The removal of miners will be a direct correlation with energy costs.  This will absolutely have a negative impact in hash power distribution.

 I agree there are possibilities for outs with this problem, but you act like it is a non-issue and is solved. I think that understates the issue.


Either way, both the original article and my concerns are on a timescale older than the technology itself, so both are unlikely to actually materialize and be true issues. But I am curious as to the solutions that can be implemented for BTC's issue mentioned. Again, what you are basically saying is it is a non-issue or the existing system innately resolves the concern and I currently disagree with that.",1626195796,2021-07-14

And fees have been greater than the block reward in the past. There's no reason to suspect this cant be true in the future (when adoption should increase fees and the block reward is decreasing... This is only more likely not less). Mining has centralizing tendencies today.. thinner margins can exacerbate that temporarily, but there's no reason to suggest (confidently as you did) that the same balance which exists today won't exist in the future. A decrease in margins leads to less participants leads to an increase in margins leads to decentralizing tendencies.

Ethereum can support much higher gas limits and throughput, as evidenced by Binance Smart Chain or Polygon PoS, both of which are Geth forks that have nodes running on SSDs. Rather, it's an intentional decision to limit state growth to an acceptable level, as requiring &gt;1 TB SSDs is thought to be a centralizing force. Some would argue it's already too much, but fortunately, statelessness + state expiry will solve this. Once implemented, stateless clients won't even need an SSD! 

All that's off topic, though, because in this projection, we are considering data shards. These are a completely different type of shard chains that only provide data availability for rollups. Thanks to techniques like erasure coding and data availability sampling, all shard nodes need not hold all data at all times - indeed, it'll be a small fraction.",1626189106,2021-07-13

Or rather, for each new block (evenh though you don't know yet which block is the actual new block), measure the number of new blocks required so that every nodes (or most nodes? How to measure nodes with poor performance in such regards? ) have added such block to their longest chain (whatever is added to their longest chain after such block). This number would be the actual number of confirmation blocks needed to consider this block as added to the chain.

Imagine a 2 lane highway with a max capacity of 200 cars/minute.

On an average day, 100 cars/minute travel through, so all is good. 

But when 300 cars try to get through at rush hour, a traffic jam occurs whereby 100 of the cars have to wait their turn to cross a given point.

They will have to wait an extra minute (for the first 200 to pass through) before they get to go through.

Now, imagine the lane gets expanded to 4 lanes, and the capacity now becomes 400 cars/minute

Now, all 300 cars get to pass through.

The ledger of all cars that went through a given point grew by 300 in a single minute vs 300 in 2 minutes.

If the city of Ethereum (where the highway is located) grows in population (dapp users), then you can expect more cars to go through every minute, and the larger 4 lane highway will have a higher capacity to accommodate for it.

Whereas previously, 10-20% of the time had the highway stuck in traffic jams, now traffic jams may be less common, but we can still expect more cars to go through.

Similarly, the number of transactions will increase, and the ledger will need to increase exponentially as well, as adoption of Ethereum is widely expected to gain steam, at least on this subreddit.

If you are a crypto bear and don't think mass adoption is incoming, then you can maybe argue storage won't necessarily increase as quickly, but either way, more hard drives will be required as the ledger keeps growing.",1626156778,2021-07-13

Each ‚Äúfull block‚Äù (ie. a block whose gas is 2x the TARGET) increases the BASEFEE by 1.125x, so a series of constant full blocks will increase the gas price by a factor of 10 every \~20 blocks (\~4.3 min on average). Hence, periods of heavy on-chain load will not realistically last longer than \~5 minutes.",1626155053,2021-07-13

Your coinbase wallet may be setting the gas price too high, so set it manually. Depending on how soon you need the transaction to go through, you can set the gas price lower. For a uniswap transaction though, its best to use the ""rapid"" amount since your transaction can fail if it takes too long since the exchange rate can move on you (and then you pay the fees and don't get the exchange which sucks).",1626150172,2021-07-13

And there's a ton of overhead, cost, challenges, and technical expertise needed to manage something with that amount of data. I'm talking about teams of dozens of people and millions of dollars of overhead cost.

ethereum,"Personally, for a trade of this size, I would wait for at least 12 blocks being confirmed (approximately 3 minutes after the transaction is added to the blockchain). 

This way, you mostly protect yourself from block reorganization (in such case, the block where your transaction is included may not end up in the final blockchain). 

Note that you may need up to 25 blocks (something like 6 minutes) in order to achieve finality and make sure there's no risk of block reorg. 

That said, the risk only exists if the creator of the transaction (the car buyer) sees the block reorg and replaces his transaction with another one (like a 0 ETH one going towards his own address and with a way higher gas fee). 

So, the risk also depends on how much confidence you have that the buyer won't want to cheat.",1626146065,2021-07-13

To me, the disadvantage of flash loans (allowing easy economical attacks of several platforms at a time) also is a strength. 

Without flash loans, these attacks could still be performed, but only by a tiny minority which may have the knowledge of it way later, compared to when everyone can access this tool.

As such, flash loans make sure there's a fierce competition between economical attackers, such that these attacks are performed as soon as detected, limiting the threat they pose. He alternative would be that one or two people would have the knowledge and wait for it to be an even greater threat.

To me, there's a parallel to make with forest fire risks. Flash loans make sure any fire starter within the forest gets lighted as soon as possible, so that there never is any fire burning the entire forest and much beyond.

ethereum,"&gt;The key word here is ""archive"" node rather than a full node though. The difference between the 2 is an archive node is everything from the first block, the 'genesis block' rather than current blocks/transactions up for validation.

It's actually even more than that. A full node has all the blocks and can derive the state of the Blockchain at any time. An archive node stores *all* historical states so it can query them quickly without re-deriving them.

&gt; Archive node
&gt; Stores everything kept in the full node and builds an archive of historical states. Needed if you want to query something like an account balance at block #4,000,000.

ethereum,"Let me start by saying this is well written but most of it is your opinion. I was recently on a twitter spaces that had politicians, fund managers, and government officials from all of the world. The topic of ""BTC replacing fiat"" came up. You're right for saying it wont, but for the wrong reasons. The United States has used soft slavery and dollar colonization to ""lead"" the world since WW2. They only way to replace the dollar is war. It's that simple. You might think i am being over dramatic but i am not. Next we have the IMF. This central bank loans money (USD) to countries in need. Right now we are seeing ""high risk"" debtors move to BTC. El Salvador and Paraguay both hold high risk IMF loans.  

Your suggestion to buy ""blue chips"" is odd. Those tokens,  DEX's and DeFi's all use the Ethereum blockchain. You need to separate ETH and Ethereum They arent the same. But when you buy ETH you're taking all of the underlying risk. An example would be if Amazon owned target and Walmart but you still invested in target. And making people understand this is the only way for mainstream adoption. 

**Take-a-ways** 

DeFi is the future of lending and personal banking. Recently Wells Fargo closed all personal credit. They see the writing on the wall. 

America backs its currency with ""the full faith and credit of the united states"" this means we protect it militarily. 

Volatility? If Eth 2.0 doesnt stem volatility, nothing will. Crypto is a hedge against inflation. 

We have already seen the dismemberment of banks through cheap debit cards with no physical location. This isnt new. But it doesnt mean banks will cease to exist. Theyll create their own DEX's (probably extracting MEV).",1626137959,2021-07-13

But what even constitutes as a 'legitimate owner'?(orginial question) You need a clear framework to even define that. Of course in standard crypto it is easy, not your keys not your coins. Unless stolen of course, how would you even go about technically defining 'legitimate' in that case?

The rest of your questions already have a predetirmined awnser and you are trying to fill in the blanks yourself and you make your conclusions. I will explain everything in a whitepaper and you are free to ask legitimate questions afterward. But right now, convincing you of anything(I can't even really figure out what you really want to know ) will cost me twice as much time as writing the paper so I am going to leave it at that!

ethereum,"That was about uncle reorg, which needs reorganization of blocks. Front running doesn't need different blocks for there to be an MEV: front running reorganization happens within the block, by organizing transactions within the new block to mine. 

I agree miners are rationale. That's why, when front running happens, aka when someone (generally a bot) sees a profitable transaction in the mempool and sends to the mempool that same transaction, but for the bot's profit and with a greater transaction fee, it is in the miner's interest to choose this transaction instead of the other one. 

Besides, you can't really know if the two transactions are legit or if one is the front running of the other. Someone could very well have seen the profitable opportunity without looking at the transaction in the mempool and have thought that they need to put a high transaction fee to make sure their transaction is very quickly mined. 

As such, there's no social layer against this, especially within the time lapse of mining 1 block. No one could tell which transactions are legit or not, except having probabilities regarding some transactions based on the past transactions of the wallet which sent them (by detecting it's a front running bot, for instance). 

The only way I see, for the moment, to make sure people don't front run is by making sure they can't look at the transactions. This way, you know for sure they didn't copy mempool transactions for their own benefits. 

There may be other solutions, like providing a timestamp to transactions in mempool, but the decentralized aspect of the mempool makes timestamping very hard to implement, if it even is possible at all.",1626115208,2021-07-13

ethereum,"Parody implies satirization of the song upon which the original is based, unless given permission by the original artist. Weird Al‚Äôs ‚Äúwhite n nerdy‚Äù works as parody because it relies on its relationship to the original song in order for the joke to land. Smells Like Nirvana is another good example.

By comparison, this song is more of a ‚ÄúTryHardNinja‚Äù style ‚Äúparody‚Äù, where he uses the original song as a base and then the content of the song is completely unrelated to the original content/intent of the music upon which it‚Äôs based.

Almost all of TryHardNinja‚Äôs ‚Äúparodies‚Äù were taken down for copyright infringement as they weren‚Äôt covered under the parody section of fair use, because technically they didn‚Äôt actually meet the legal definition for ‚Äúparody‚Äù. Technically, they were standalone songs that used melody, harmony, and instrumentation of existing music as the base for an entirely different song, without any transformation, other than the lyrical content.

Which isn‚Äôt to say Weird Al didn‚Äôt do that as well. However, Weird Al famously had permission from the original artists for every song he made, which is why songs like ‚ÄúThe Saga Begins‚Äù being completely unrelated to their source material is ok. He had permission to use the song as a base for his ‚Äúparody‚Äù.

Not making a judgement statement on TryHardNinja or the OP, just pointing out the discrepancy in parody law. Technically this song isn‚Äôt a parody, as it doesn‚Äôt satirize the original song, and therefor likely wouldn‚Äôt be covered under fair use.

Now, whether or not copyright law as it currently exists is something that‚Äôs good for music or culture in general is an entirely different story.",1626113962,2021-07-13

An ""account"" is just a public key - private key pair.  You can't ""log in"" to ethereum, but you can use any wallet tool (metamask, for instance) to get access to an account.  Once you have an account, you may deploy a smart contract, but it's not so simple, and it costs money, so it's not something you necessarily want to do just for fun.

The cost of mining is intensive and as the block reward continually decreases, the profit margin of a miner dwindles and will likely be negative.

The argument that the Bitcoin price will continually increase to offset the havening is unfounded.

Decentralisation at least in block chain doesn't always mean, every node must play authorities.
Authority may be central, but the ledger and the result can be decentralised.
Lets assume an example of govt tender, which executes on a lowest bid.
The smart contract would be signed off by a single entity thats the govt, but the participating nodes can be sure that the smart contract is not tampered by evaluating the ledger.
Consider it a close hybrid of decentralisation.
Data is generated in a centralized manner, but the evaluation and the result is shared by all participants, there by ensuring trust. Here you have to see the transperency of data recieved rather than the generation of it as distributed.",1626093975,2021-07-12

That is still true in Sarcophagus, there is an incentive to reveal at a certain time.

ethereum,"Now I better understand, thank you very much about this. 

Well, this is a problem that won't be solved by PoS itself, so it will have to be addressed at some point. I see there are at least two ways to solve it, for the moment, so it's not that bad anyway. 

With the progress made regarding DeFi and the sophistication of the financial products it offers, this problem will get bigger and bigger, so it will have to be addressed sooner rather than later. 

The first way I see for the moment to solve such problem is for any platform to be able to run nodes and deter any malevolent behavior (like any front running) they detect. 

In a sense, this is a problem that may be solved by L2: on any L2, stakers will have the incentive to make sure the environment is benevolent towards legitimate users and doesn't repulse them by stealing their profitable transactions through frontrunning practices. That said, it also means L2 ecosystems would have to judge whether any transaction is a frontrun of any other one or a genuine transaction that didn't know other transactions existed. It will be a difficult problem to solve in itself. So, this solution only partially solves the problem. 

Without L2, another way to solve this problem (probably in a more efficient way) would be to implement transaction privacy, so that bots (or anyone else, for the matter) simply can't read transactions to front run them. With transaction privacy regarding very profitable transactions, finders are keepers. 

As such, there will be for the ecosystem (and notably for developers) some care to take about who can interact with the smart contracts: when a transaction can be run by anyone and can have financial benefit by being frontrun, there may be an incentive to show to users such transactions should be run privately, through encryption.",1626055086,2021-07-12

ethereum,"A technical point - this EIP can theoretically allow for further block size (gas limit) increases by the miners

The reason is that pre-1559, the fees were getting so crazy high, that there was legitimate concern that block rewards may start to matter much less. A fair bit of academic research has shown that blockchains become unstable if fee revenue dominates block reward revenue. The topic to search is ""selfish mining""

By burning fees, we help resolve improve this situation in two ways:

1) If it's true that miners get less fees overall, that reduces the risk. This is offset by eth becoming more deflationary imo

2) Alternatively, if lots of eth gets burned, eth block rewards could be increased. This also helps 

Anyway, huge wins all around, can't wait to see it in practice. Going to be very hype to see all the burned eth - and hopefully not have to play the gas fee game in MetaMask as much...

ethereum,"That worked great until this year's meme tokens took off. People overloaded the network using Ethereum dapps like Uniswap to convert into Shiba (or something worse), providing liquidity for it, etc. What used to cost $5 to do on Uniswap was costing me about $40-$80 a few weeks ago. Then worse, a lot of people's first introduction to Crypto was at the peak when they bought $1000 in a meme but paid $800 in Ethereum gas to process the request, que ""it's a scam!"" I worry as the network grows more organically it'll become $800 for any transaction eventually.

Since then in the same day it'll jump between $1 and $20 to send to a wallet or $10-50 to join or leave a liquidity pool. It was low (under 1gwei) for a while then Shibaswap came out this week and made it bad again. You can see what fees are at www.gasnow.org, sometimes it'll save $20 to use the network at 5am instead of 9am. If you're only making $25 to be in an LP it doesn't make sense to pay $30 gas so lots of the cool stuff has been restricted to people with 1+ eth to play with. 

I've been following this pretty heavily and L2 seem like the only solutions to the scaling problem so far until sharding comes (which splits the main chain into 64 chains). I imagine anyone with even $10 will be able to do swaps or do LP (for 60-100% APY) for a couple cents in gas after another couple weeks. 

If the network grows much more we may all have to migrate to an L2 eventually. If gas is $800 and we're splitting it with 1000 other people no one will care.

If you keep Ethereum on an exchange you don't pay for gas. Some exchanges cover the first $5 or $10 so you might not have had to pay for any yet if you're just sending it out but keep an eye on it next time in case we're in another peak again.",1626041987,2021-07-12

Anyway there're a lot of other things, I usually end up contributing to one or another by chance. Like I use it, I see something missing, I discuss/make a PR.

There's a variety of things you could do, it all depends on what you like and also what you're the most comfortable with.

So for me the entry point it to use the ecosystem. For instance I love open source and if something in the ecosystem is not open source and I want to use it, I could be tempted to create my own version. Dashboards for example, sometimes the backend code is not open sourced. That's how I've built [pools (React front)](https://github.com/AndreMiras/pools), [pools-api (Python backend)](https://github.com/AndreMiras/pools-api), [libpools (Python library)](https://github.com/AndreMiras/libpools) for my own use. Sometimes simple wrappers/libraries to dapps are missing, maybe things like uniswap, 1inch, compound... or it exists, but missing tons of features.

That's also how I got involved some time ago in libraries like pyethereum, pyethapp, pydevp2p, py-etherscan-api (most of them got revamped and are discontinued now) 

The london/EIP-1559 update is another example where one could contribute. For example by updating the Python web3 client [https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py). A PR covering this already got merged rencently, but maybe there's more to do, I haven't checked.

List goes on and on.

But generally speaking I feel like there's more space for JS (back &amp; front) development in the Ethereum ecosystem. Sorry for the troll, it's my personal feeling and I could be wrong. I'm definitely more of a Python guy (core developer of Python-for-Android among other things), but I've made the switch recently because I felt like JS had more opportunities for getting involved as a hobby and pro fullstack dev in the blockchain space.",1626036031,2021-07-12

ethereum,"Hard to guess, it depends on network usage. How it works is if the gas price is 10 GWEI and you pay 13, then 3 is returned to you and 10 gets burned.

Right now if we pay 13 the next person pays 14 to get in and the third person who paid 10 gets left hanging from the minute since their wallet last loaded gas prices. After EIP1559 we won't have to guess what to pay to get into the next block which has the chance to reduce the potential fees/burn (dispite what people here think) during volitile times.

L2's like Arbitirium and Optimism are right around the corner. There's a *comments* section on every Ethereum TX and L2's cram 100-1000+ transactions into there for gas savings. If the ecosystem jumps onto those the ETH burn might only be &gt;1GWEI per transaction, so not much. If ETH gas prices are under ~1 GWEI it defeats the need for an L2 though so it'll reach some equilibrium above that. If ETH gas is ~10 GWEI (after sharding) it should burn enough to become deflationary.

So whatever we pay for gas now is a bad metric to use for what will be burned later on. Especially moreso with sharding.

Pretty much the same story here... Blockchains and DLT in general ignited my passion for programming and Computer Science / Math again.

Given that it's hard to navigate the space from a technical perspective I started the CryptoDevHub project which is a community-driven effort to gather and catalog the best resources for aspiring Blockchain / dApp developers:

https://cryptodevhub.io

There's the Wiki you can browse through to discover tutorials, tools, communities, media outlets, etc.: https://cryptodevhub.io/wiki

For newcomers we put together a ""Getting Started"" guide which helps you get from complete beginner to proficient Smart Contract developer: https://cryptodevhub.io/wiki/blockchain-development-tutorial

And there's also a Discord you can join to meet fellow developers and ask further questions: https://cryptodevhub.io/discord",1625993832,2021-07-11

Belief in Triple halving per devs:
&gt; There is little to ""believe"" in: it is just a matter at looking at PoW versus PoS issuance. Right now PoW issuance is roughly 13,500 ETH/day. In comparison PoS issuance with 14M ETH staking is roughly 1,700 ETH/day ETH per day. So even with 14M ETH staking (for context we currently have 5.7M ETH staking) 1,700 ETH/day is roughly 8x less than 13,500 ETH/day and an 8x issuance reduction is the equivalent of three halvings in Bitcoin land.
&gt;

ultra sound money - token cap:

&gt;Likely soon‚Ñ¢. A criterion for qualifying as ultra sound money is decreasing supply which could be achieved post-merge if fee burn from EIP-1559 is greater than PoS issuance. I have high confidence (95%+) that the supply will start decreasing post-merge and that the supply at merge (projected to be around 120M ETH) will be a de facto supply peak for the lifetime of Ethereum. Note that monetary deflation implies ""No Supply Floor‚Ñ¢"", as David Hoffman would say :)

A potential advantage is block *speed*, but there's not really a reason you can't have large blocks and fast block speed.

ethereum,"Apologies for the delay, it's been a crazy week. Also for the wall of text.

I'll start with the stuff that I do agree with. I certainly agree that the current decade is all about DeFi and non-sovereign money has taken a back seat (though I will say I still think non-sovereign money performs an important function). I also agree that a major handicap Ethereum has is its constant innovation, making it difficult for developers to plan X years into the future. 

But I take issue with his last paragraph, and Qureshi's post. I do not agree that decentralization should be a secondary design dimension, and more importantly, that systems naturally decentralize over time. 

Decentralization is the most important design dimension, because without it, there is no reason to use a blockchain at all. Anything that Ethereum or Solana does, could certainly be done faster and more efficiently in a database managed by Google or Amazon. If they are right, and decentralization doesn't matter, then the whole crypto-experiment will fail, because a centralized entity will always beat out a decentralized one on performance, cost, efficiency, etc. 

I agree that the average user today, even most of the power users actively engaging in DeFi, lack the knowledge to actively evaluate the level of decentralization on their own - and just believe what they've been told. But if we're talking about real adoption, global adoption on the scale of governments and entire industries, real decentralization is paramount. The governments of China and the US aren't going to just trust what some redditor posts, nor are they going to rely on a blockchain that can be subverted by another power. The US isn't going to put public records on BNB, for example.

As for decentralization over time, I think it's the exact opposite. I think it's a U shape. Systems start necessarily centralized, and do decentralize over their early life. However, once the level of value of the system grows, they again tend towards centralization. Qureshi gives the perfect example of this in his own post - the internet. It start naturally centralized, hosted by a few government entities and universities. Then, over time (late 90s, early 2000s) became very decentralized. Then it became very valuable, and it reverted to centralization. His argument that it tends towards decentralization is rooted in his belief that Web 3.0 will make it decentralized again, but my take is that most of Web 3.0 will suffer the same fate.

Decentralization must be paramount in the early life, because it's actually all but impossible to grow more decentralized once there is great value. Take Bitcoin as an example. It started centralized, with Satoshi and Finney as the only miners. Then, in it's early life, it grew more and more decentralized. But then the value grew. Because adequate protections were not in place, it became more and more centralized - at least with respect to mining. How could you pull that back now? There are methods to increase decentralization. For example, Monero uses ASIC-resistant algorithms that help to prevent such centralization. But it's too late, because you'd need those same centralized entities to willingly give up their power, which is never going happen. I think the same fate will happen to any blockchain that doesn't prioritize decentralization in the protocol early in its life.",1625945527,2021-07-11

If Eth 2.0 ever is completed (and let‚Äôs face it‚Äôs been a while due to the complex nature of the undertaking ) the staking limit should be removed down to 1 or even 0.5 Eth so then the barrier of entry is reduced and the network can have a more decentralised PoS.

Another DeFi summer

Ôøº

Natalie

1 hour ago¬∑3 min read

Ôøº

Check the NFT of this picture¬†here
During the second quarter of 2021, over 120 projects were by the 70+ blockchain VCs I follow. Yes, my VC watch list has grown from¬†20¬†to 70ish because more VCs are actively investing. And by VC, I mean crypto funds, DAOs, exchanges, and established crypto projects.
Trends I picked up by a look at the 120+ projects of Q2:

Multi-layer &amp; multi-chain

Going mobile;

Main themes: DeFi, NFT, Games, Infrastructure, institutional services, with DeFi taking up the majority of investments, which preludes another DeFi summer or autumn;

Ôøº

Ôøº

DeFi keywords: yield, liquidity, fixed-rate interest, real-world assets, gameFi and DEXes and Oracles on newly emerged non-Ethereum blockchains;
NFT keywords: marketplaces, art/gaming collectibles, and a few tapping into social media as NFT, NFT as collateral, NFT oracle, hash power NFT, etc. which gradually bridging NFT with DeFi;
Infrastructure keywords: APIs, privacy layer, bridge, CDN, and payment rails;
Other less obvious trends:

The fusion of real-world and blockchain with real-world assets as collateral on DeFi branded NFT drops and celebrities trying to get on the wagon. What do traditional businesses need to blockchain-fy? That‚Äôs another huge opportunity there;

More community DAOs getting into quality investment deals, e.g., The LAO and Deeper DAO;

Singapore leads global blockchain innovation as most Chinese projects exited from China (at least on paper), followed by San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, London, and Hong Kong.

Two more predictions:
Two potential trends have yet been unveiled, but I am really excited about: DAOs and social networks. Investment DAOs are likely to go viral with incentives built in the DAO; one bottleneck now is compliance, which warded most interested users off. Unfortunately, the barrier of entry will not grow less in any short time. That‚Äôs the glass ceiling there. Nonetheless, it‚Äôs a start.
Another trend I am personally fascinated to see is the emergence of many different decentralized social networks willing to have tried. As for what makes a good social network, the foundations lie in governances, which DAO will naturally be part of that social network; other popular themes like social media NFT and social token will also likely get embedded, last but not least, such social network will incorporate peer to peer media into the platform with incentives built for publishing and distribution. And, of course, privacy will be built in. It will not be easy. Each feature will likely be a standalone dAPP on a major network. Hopefully, we can see many different renditions and ‚Äúvote‚Äù for the best social network that will not harm the human race as a whole.
Notes

The data is from Crunchbase Pro, which is data crawled from public resources. Hence it is most likely to be not exhaustive.

Categorizing is tricky. The categories I use are not100% mutually exclusive, e.g., games can have NFT feature or DeFi function, but in those cases, I categorize games with NFT feature as games, whereas games with Defi function as DeFi. My logic is to define it with the dominant feature;

ethereum,"You said ""All these things are wrong"" but didn't even bother explaining why any of the things I said are wrong, pretty weird of you to say something like that.

Public blockchains are settlement layers, which needs throughput, and not transaction layers, which is what a L2 is for if you need real transaction performance. Real tx perf is sub-second latency, if not sub millisecond, which a public blockchain can't do ever. Best you can get is collecting txs into some other faster but more centralized ledger -or- some zk kernel and settling it to mainnet periodically. Moreover, its rare that an app needs sub-minute transactional latency and not sub-second. However, it's common if not universal that an app needs more throughput and can leverage horizontal scaling, which is where blockchains that actually scale come in.

Come to terms with that fact",1625862646,2021-07-10

ethereum,"All these things are wrong and let me explain why:

Stock trading is mostly done via l2 nowadays, you tell your broker, who has stock on hand, they reconcile with the market as they find convenient but mostly fulfill through dark pools, nobody buys 1 share of Tesla on the nyse, the settling and trading costs would be stupid.

Dapps will mostly have their own l2s, or large dapp l2 hosts, you work through them, the tradeoff is they have to keep settlement reserves/collateral on main chain and if they violate they forfeit those via contract.

The different l2s will have peering agreements like isps. 

This is literally how life works now, the difference is we don't have to go through court when things go wrong.",1625861819,2021-07-10

ethereum,"tldr; Cold storage refers to the offline storage of cryptocurrencies to reduce the potential of attack by hackers and online thieves. Bitcoin cold storage requires the physical access of a crypto investor, making it a safer alternative to online storage on exchanges for bitcoins or other digital currencies. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized and transactions are done from the point of anonymity of investors.

ethereum,"tldr; Cryptocurrencies are best understood by examining the community structure and cultural values they exhibit, rather than the economic activity they create, says Paul Ennis. Ennis defines a cryptoculture as an open source community with its own micro-economy.

There is no ETH 2.0 and it was a miscommunication that got out of hand. The use of that term made people think of it they way you have which is why no one sensible refers to it as ETH2.0 anymore.
Ethereum has always been a constantly improving protocol. Moving to proof of stake and scaling were always on the roadmap even before it was launched. Why do you then treat those improvements as a separate blockchain?
The beacon chain was launched separately because it's a new technology and needs production testing. Which is why withdrawals are not enabled yet. When it gets merged, theres always going to be only one ETH without a numbered version.

ethereum,"Here's what youre missing - the effects of the merge and 1559 effect the fundamental value of ETH. You are mistakenly assuming that the current price of ETH is based on fundamentals and not mostly still speculation.

If the current fundamental value of ETH is $200 (being very generous there) and 1559 leads to a 5% increase in fundamental value of ETH - that moves the price of ETH $10. Whether the price of ETH is $200, $2000, $20000 - it doesn't matter. It moves the price of ETH up $10. It can be a very significant fundamental effect, but when the price is dramatically higher than the fundamental value because of speculation, it's insignificant and is nowhere near enough to compensate for the potential loss from speculation drying up.

The same math after the merge is dramatically worse for the value of ETH. What is sustaining the price of BTC is it's properties as a store of value.

ethereum,"&gt;Ethereum 100/100 in fundamentals

ETH is going to be around forever, much like BTC. It's the scaling and the limits of solidity that will hold it back from real ""change"". That doesn't mean it can't be a great showroom for the early phase of defi. See gas costs of defi on ETH, wider spread adoption just makes things worse. Moreover, solidity is just a monster to develop in so when we're talking big money dapps they can't advance too much too fast, it's just not safe. All that said, the ecosystem is in a weird place right now where decentralization is forgotten in the pursuit of profits and things like binance chain and layer 2 solutions are accepted without much consideration. Blockchains being decentralized is core to resiliency, but decentralization is slower.  
  
Until we see defi volume on a platform that can scale without limits, so that gas costs can be kept down, crypto and defi will be more of an ""epcot like showroom"" than the ""future"".

ethereum,"&gt; I‚Äôm not neglecting any facts, the numbers are what they are. Let‚Äôs not conflate staking with DeFi. ETH is bleeding out of DeFi while WBTC is growing. This is an empirical fact.

The only thing that is an empirical fact is that you believe to have identified a so far temporary trend that may or may not continue. As long as the value of ETH as collateral is greater than the value of BTC as collateral, your claims are unsubstantiated and have no merits.

&gt;It will become clear that ETH will become temporarily deflationary post 2.0 and 1559. It is not clear that it will stay that way, because the main thing that‚Äôs clear right now is that ETH has never hesitated to change monetary policy during regular hard forks. You have to actually convince investors that is going to stop not by what you say, but by what you do - and that‚Äôs going to take a long time. Right now institutional investors are not giving ETH the benefit of the doubt (I consult with hedge funds regularly and they have all expressed this concern.)

I wish you the best of luck trying to convince ETH holders and stakers to increase the block rewards after they have experienced a supply shock equivalent to three bitcoin halvings. The only reason Ethereum would ever increase block rewards is for security reasons. Given the fact that Ethereum can achieve deflation while at the same time paying out consistent block rewards, I see no security threat. It will have a fixed security budget while not inflating the supply. This benefits both holders + stakers as well as the protocol itself.

Ethereum's monetary policy is minimum viable issuance. As such there would have to be a security issue to raise block rewards. Ethereum has a history of precisely following this policy. Any increase in block rewards without an underlying security issue would be unprecedented, highly scrutinized by the community, and ultimately rejected.",1625835845,2021-07-09

ethereum,"&gt;You‚Äôll have a point when the numbers start turning the direction that you hope they do. There is currently no evidence of that happening.

You're also neglecting the fact that quite likely, a lot of the ETH that was locked in DeFi went to the deposit contract to obtain staked ETH derivatives. 

&gt;The reason is simple - people are assessing the custody risk of WBTC to be lower than the risk that ETH drops in value.

I think this is a very bad take and it will become clear that ETH after EIP-1559 and the merge will be close to deflationary or deflationary, which means it has less inflation than Bitcoin for a good decade + possibility of deflation.

&gt;So ETH ultimately shares the same theoretical concern that at some point it may be required to increase inflation to keep the chain secure. It‚Äôs a distant concern in either case and not even worth trying to determine which is more likely. If you ask me, I think ETH runs into that problem first.

I'm really excited for these mental gymnastics. A chain that will always have block rewards will first have to increase them vs a chain that continually cuts them down and has no way to generate reliable fee revenue. Please.. have some self respect and don't clown on me.",1625834917,2021-07-09
ethereum,"You‚Äôll have a point when the numbers start turning the direction that you hope they do. There is currently no evidence of that happening. 

The reason is simple - people are assessing the custody risk of WBTC to be lower than the risk that ETH drops in value. Over the long term, BTC has held its value better than ETH (ETH still hasn‚Äôt surpassed its ETH/BTC ATH.)

ETH under PoS is secured by the value of the stake. Inflation is required to pay a yield to stakers. If ETH drops to $100, the value of that stake drops by 95%, and so will the yield in nominal terms. The yield doesn‚Äôt change in percentage terms, but at some point the yield could become too small in nominal terms to adequately secure the chain, and it needs to be increased in percentage terms to compensate. 

So ETH ultimately shares the same theoretical concern that at some point it may be required to increase inflation to keep the chain secure.

What BTC people get that ETH people don‚Äôt is that setting the precedent that hard forks are acceptable completely undermines the integrity of the supply cap. Especially when you regularly use is to change monetary policy. No one knows wtf the supply of ETH will ever be because you keep changing it. You keep saying ‚Äúthis time it‚Äôs different‚Äù but it never is. If the value of ETH drops and you need to increase inflation even once to keep ETH secure under PoS, you can just flush down the toilet any sort of narrative that ETH is going to be reliably scarce. Almost no one with serious money believes that ETH is scarce right now. That trust takes years and years to build and every time you hard fork and change monetary policy you reset the clock.",1625833849,2021-07-09
ethereum,"&gt;According to DeFi Pulse, there‚Äôs about $20M worth of ETH and $5B worth of WBTC locked. So only 4X, not an order of magnitude anymore. Hasn‚Äôt been for a while. More importantly, over the past year the share of BTC is increasing (went up 10X, while the share of ETH is up only 3X). Over 90 days, ETH dropped from 11M ‚Äúlocked‚Äù to 9M, while WBTC is up from 135K to 165K. This trend has been consistent.

ETH has been immediately usable as soon as DeFi was ""created"", so it had a rapid rise as collateral and is now plateauing out. It took some months for wBTC to exist and then catch on, which is why it has recently risen as much, and is now plateauing. It makes absolutely no sense for wBTC to be preferred over ETH given the fact that it's a custodial solution and also carries additional smart contract risk, whereas ETH as the native asset isn't created through a smart contract and does not carry this risk.

&gt;Your narrative is slowly falling apart. It looks like only a matter of time before WBTC overtakes ETH as collateral on DeFi.

It's your narrative that is ""falling apart"", or better yet, it has never existed in the first place. wBTC will never replace ETH as the dominant collateral on Ethereum. That's a pipe dream. And if it does, then Bitcoin's security is in jeopardy.

&gt;The value of ETH stake dropping under PoS will likely be a security issue long before fees become an issue.

Can you explain what you mean by ""the value of ETH stake dropping""? Doesn't make sense to me.

The answer is: Tron is proof of stake. The marketcap is $4bn. To have 51% you‚Äôd have to spend $2Bn and you ‚Äòown the network‚Äô. 

The Ethereum marketcap is $247bn. Moving to proof of stake means that acquiring more than half of the tokens will cost at least $123.5bn.

Second, the Bitcoin that is locked on the Bitcoin blockchain and used on Ethereum doesn't pay transaction fees on Bitcoin's blockchain anymore, for as long as it is used. So what happens when more and more Bitcoin becomes wrapped on Ethereum?

ethereum,"Home loans are a privilege that many do not have access to anyway. It's reasonable to suggest we can't replace banks because a subset of people depend on the protections in place for particular services, because banks actually serve them. 

There is another subset of people who are thrift depositors in the barest sense - their income cannot support large purchases and they may not even consider loans. Banks are punching down when they charge these clients overdraft fees, transfer fees, ATM withdrawal fees and processing fees in general.

These are fees that a wealthy client might negotiate down or have waived by the bank in context of other services, but this set of depositors have no leverage and may not even consider whether negotiations are possible. Their get-in/get-out minimization of interactions with financial entities, likely reinforced by their one-sided dependence on an employer's direct deposit or similar service, never signals real cost, risk or harm to the bank on a fundamental level. And yet fees are more likely to increase rather than to be reduced.

These depositors, in sum, can be charged exorbitant amounts for the most basic services while shareholders and executives at the bank make a mint. Considering these collected fees, in sum, only mitigate a fraction of the financial risk and leverage the bank will take on, even with regulatory oversight, we can accurately describe them as discretionary, punitive and pointless for any business that wants to retain clients. They don't accurately represent a cost and even if they did, the costs are not applied equitably but with discretion and an eye to maximize profit. They don't want these clients, that is the market signal these depositors never seem to get the hint about, despite all the fees. 

Storing value securely and earning yield without egregious fees is a no-brainer. The idea that decentralized systems will trounce the current bank offerings for thrift depositors is a symptom of taking people for granted. Banks could turn around their policies today and I'm not sure the people conditioned to accept bank fees would choose them over a new technology or service provider, like blockchain and ethereum.

If something goes wrong, I can chat with my loan officer, and he can work with his underwriting team to correct mistakes or get clarification on edge cases.

With DeFi, that human element is missing. 

Sure, some loans can be done without the human element. But there are so many moving pieces and complex variables as part of these bigger transactions. To be able to reduce these variables to code is an enormous task that ethereum is not close enough to handling.

Without that element, ethereum cannot be a competitor to banks. At best, right now, banks can steal elements from ethereum technology and incorporate it to make themselves more efficient.

ethereum,"&gt; don't trust ethereum to be implemented in the scale it could be

Either that or they don't believe Ethereum can scale in a meaningful way and on a reasonable timescale

From [Technical Scalability Creates Social Scalability](https://multicoin.capital/2021/05/25/technical-scalability-creates-social-scalability/) (also mentioned in my above post):


&gt; Because no one actually knows how Ethereum is going to scale. As a simple example, Vitalik has said that he believes in the near-to-medium term, optimistic roll ups are likely the best scaling solution, and that in the long term, zk-rollups will become dominant. When and how will this transition happen? What infrastructure will need to be (re)built? How will capital flow between these various roll ups, and what are the implications for smart contract developers, wallets, users, liquidity providers, fiat on ramps, etc.?

&gt; Moreover, it appears that whatever scaling solutions end up mattering, it‚Äôs unlikely that there is a single monolithic instantiation of that scaling solution (meaning, for example, a single Optimism roll up). The future of Ethereum scaling is going to be heterogeneous.

[...]

&gt; All of the rollup-based scaling solutions are subject to the problems I outlined above. The same is true for sharding. Despite billions in research and development from an array of capable teams (Cosmos, Polkadot, Avalanche, etc.), none of the sharding systems actually work at meaningful scale (most don‚Äôt even work in production at all). Even once they work at proof-of-concept scale, there will be lots of emergent problems that have to be managed (e.g. failed cross-shard transactions, exchange integrations, and more).

&gt; To be clear, I‚Äôm not saying that scaling via sharding and roll ups can‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm actually reasonably optimistic that both solutions will, eventually. But, both of these scaling strategies don‚Äôt really work today, and will create a lot of secondary and tertiary problems that have to be worked through. It‚Äôs hard to see a world in which impartial organizations that demand certainty around scalability will get the certainty they need in the next 24 months because there are just so many intertwined components to scaling Ethereum.",1625745990,2021-07-08

ethereum,"&gt; In a few years though, there will be more specialized blockchains: it should then be easier to determine whether it makes more sense to specialize for industry needs or attempt to change everything all at once (like Ethereum is doing).

For a blockchain to change to be good at ""everything at once"", it needs to scale beyond what seems realistic for ETH2 

In this context, see the below essay from Multicoin, where Ethereum and Solana are describes as pareto-efficient solutions, with Ethereum maximizing for decentralisation &amp; censorship-resistantance and Solana optimizing for high-throughput DeFi applications. They then argue:

&gt; This essay assumes that the most important function of a blockchain is not non-sovereign money in and of itself. Rather, the most important function of a blockchain is DeFi.

&gt; Changing the primary function of the system from being strictly about censorship-resistant, non-sovereign money, to a highly functional and programmable development environment for financial applications should have impacts on every single layer of the technology stack from the networking layer (e.g. gossip vs Turbine) through the execution environment (e.g. EVM vs SeaLevel). 

To conclude:

&gt; For the first decade of crypto since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009, it was clear that censorship-resistant, non-sovereign money was the dog, and other applications were the tail.

 &gt; But that is changing. It is now clear to everyone in crypto that DeFi is going to completely reshape finance. I contend that roles have reversed: DeFi is the dog, and non-sovereign money is the tail.
 Both require degrees of censorship resistance, but given engineering constraints, there is a **fundamental trade-off between maximizing the utility of DeFi, and maximizing the censorship resistance** of the system.

&gt; **When the fundamental design goals of the system change, so should the tech stack.** In order to scale DeFi to billions of people, every layer of the stack has to be reconsidered from first principles.

When I first heard about stablecoins I was perplexed, how could it work? Crypto is super-volatile, how could tokens built on it ever be 1:1 with USD without serious market manipulation? At least with Dai I get it, it's backed by Ether. The way it stays stable is the ""miners"" are actually maintainers/traders. They contribute a pool of Eth and Dai coins together, usually 150-250% more Eth (because crypto is volatile). When Dai goes up in price say to $1.01, they sell some Dai to buy some Eth, lowering the Dai price back to $1.00, and they pocket the $.01 profit. When Dai lowers to $.98, they trade Eth to buy some Dai at the discounted price, raising the Dai price back to $1.00, and they pocket the $.02 profit per Dai purchased. Dai ""miners"" profit from the volatility.

At least I get that, I understand that. The only thing that could truly disrupt the price of Dai is if Eth crashed to absolute 0. But the other stablecoins I don't understand, so I won't mess with them. And the Tether video doesn't help!",1625726926,2021-07-08

In short, it helps depreciate faster abandonned chains, so that people don't get scammed by using a very old chain while falsely believing they're using the most recent one. 

It's a cheap way to make sure that, among all the code versions of a given blockchain, only the ones who get maintained are usable. 

As such, you end up with two types of forks: forks where the old code isn't maintained anymore and forks where the old code is maintained. 

For instance, with the fork leading to ETC and ETH, the two codes were maintained by different developers. But with all the other code updates since the birth of ETH, only the newer version was maintained.",1625726013,2021-07-08

ICOs didn't change the world and neither will DeFi and NFTs, both of which are the worst examples of a speculative frenzy that I've ever seen.

Until we start to see DeFi and NFT projects failing we're still in the middle of a hype bubble that's pumping up everything. Almost nothing of lasting value came out of the ICO craze. When the dust settles and the regulators start cracking down, we'll see what's left of DeFi. Probably very little.",1625713247,2021-07-08

ethereum,"&gt;Well if we‚Äôre talking about the utility value which is based on people buying ETH to use in transactions, that should be reflected immediately in present value, not long term.

I think I'm using the word value in a different sense to you. I meant that using the network - as opposed to a centralised or forked alternative - provides utility to users because of the dollar linked DeFi ecosystem. This market share isn't necessarily reflected in price terms.

&gt;If ETH just gained significant utility outside of a hype bubble as it did in 2019 and there wasn‚Äôt a commensurate increase in value, that‚Äôs more evidence that utility actually can‚Äôt support the present valuation. 

I completely agree with this. However, from my perspective the monetary value of the network won't be realised until the transaction capacity rises with staking and sharding; until then it is a (promising) technology demonstration.

My point about utility value related to the fact that the value locked in ethereum creates a catholic (in the technical sense) network architecture.

In essence, the system has a low actual value right now. But no one buys because of what it is right now; they buy because of what it could be.",1625712827,2021-07-08

On the first of every month, if your Eth wallet has the available funds for rent, it gets automatically transferred to the landlord, and the apartment door remains unlocked. If you don't have the funds, the smart contract executes, telling the apartment door lock to invalidate your key &amp; lock you out.

In reality, people rarely ever get kicked to the curb instantaneously for non-payment of rent. Most times the landlord is willing to work with you, if you're waiting on a late paycheck or something. Even then, eviction laws vary by country, state, region, and city, and there's usually many intermediary steps like legal notices, demands, and deadlines in between the non-payment and a police officer forcing you to leave. A Court judge usually gets involved who can proceed with the eviction like normal, or make special exceptions based on circumstances.

Smart contracts don't take any of that into account. You could've left to take your dog for a walk, or pick up groceries, and the smart contract will coldly lock you out right then, with all your possessions still locked inside, possibly even: your wallet, phone, and car keys. No exceptions, even if the landlord is willing to work with you, the smart contracts don't care. And remember, nobody can shut them down, not even the creator!",1625693676,2021-07-08

I disagree for high value use cases, because the value of the stake and the supporting infrastructure provides the utility and security guarantee.

ethereum,"Just to add something about the first topic of smart contracts:

&gt;Lend, borrow, swap, &amp; do much more with them!

Lending and borrowing are not possible with smart contracts alone, they are made possible thanks to oracle networks which bring off-chain data to the blockchain. For example, there must be an oracle to provide the price of 1 ETH in USDC, so the application knows how much you can borrow and knows when to liquidate you. Without oracles there's no Aave or Compound.

Now about swapping, it doesn't require oracles because the prices are determined by the ratios in the liquidity pools, so if there's a pair made of 10k USDC and 1 ETH, that'll be the price of ETH in USDC.",1625684592,2021-07-08

Price is mostly supply and demand. But it's also how easy or hard it is to make more of the product, and what materials are involved/what they cost.
In this case making eth will take more eth, so if % apy was 1, you'd need at least 100 eth staked for a year to produce it, so as long as demand exceeds that, price will go up (assuming there won't be a panic that causes people to panic sell under reasonable prices, which probably will still happen).

That base fee is getting burned. So the more either is used, the more gets burned.

In comparison PoS issuance with 14M ETH staking is roughly 1,700 ETH/day ETH per day. So even with 14M ETH staking (for context we currently have 5.7M ETH staking) 1,700 ETH/day is roughly 8x less than 13,500 ETH/day and an 8x issuance reduction is the equivalent of three halvings in Bitcoin land.

ethereum,"&gt; In ""normal"" (non-activity leak) circumstances, a validator loses approximately 15.8% of their stake per year they are offline. That's ~1.4% for being offline for a month or ~0.3% for being offline for a week.

I understand the statement ""high"" is relative.  But for someone who is just hosting at home, 1 week of downtime in a given year isn't really that high.

As such, I'm beginning to wonder if L2 solutions will be enough to significantly decrease transaction costs, even more so if many more transactions try to be computed on the Ethereum network.

What OP meant to say there was it is a clever ploy to hide whales with large no. of tokens who say had 10 billion of the token on deploy which was 10%. Now after burning 50 billion, the same person would now have 20% of the remaining token while most sites will still list that person as having 10% unless there is a way to specifically remove the burnt tokens from the supply.

The good news here is ethereum being used as a platform and potentially using nft to assert ownership rights on tradeable assets like used games or collectibles.

I don‚Äôt want to be a dick but you don‚Äôt even get what could be exciting about this. 

To be a bigger dick, it‚Äôs also possible gme mgmt is just trying to pump their stock more by aligning with the current trend aka crypto.

Will the ‚ÄúTriple Halvening‚Äù really happen once EIP1559 and the merge are complete? EIP1559 has been referred to as ‚ÄúThe Scarcity Engine‚Äù but will there be an actual supply limit &amp; if so what number will the coins cap at? Lastly is ETH defined as ‚Äúultrasound‚Äù money? EXPLAINED

*These answers are taken directly from the Ethereum Foundation development team. These aren‚Äôt coming from me rather the individuals who are currently working on the merge, /u/vbuterin included.*

Triple Halvening?

There is little to ""believe"" in: it is just a matter at looking at PoW versus PoS issuance. Right now PoW issuance is roughly 13,500 ETH/day. In comparison PoS issuance with 14M ETH staking is roughly 1,700 ETH/day ETH per day. So even with 14M ETH staking (for context we currently have 5.7M ETH staking) 1,700 ETH/day is roughly 8x less than 13,500 ETH/day and an 8x issuance reduction is the equivalent of three halvings in Bitcoin land.

Ultrasound Money?

Likely soon‚Ñ¢. A criterion for qualifying as ultra sound money is decreasing supply which could be achieved post-merge if fee burn from EIP-1559 is greater than PoS issuance. I have high confidence (95%+) that the supply will start decreasing post-merge and that the supply at merge (projected **to be around 120M ETH)** will be a **de facto supply peak for the lifetime of Ethereum.** Note that monetary deflation implies ""No Supply Floor‚Ñ¢"", as David Hoffman would say :)

*I‚Äôll be editing this adding a few links to learn more about ultrasound money later on.*

I didn‚Äôt create or market those terms. That‚Äôs ether foundation  marketing ‚Äúthe scarcity engine‚Äù in reference to 1559 and triple halvening referring to 1559 and proof of stake. 

**TL;DR: The triple Halvening will happen. There will be a limited supply of ETH after the merge, and the projected coin limit is 120 Million. Lastly, ETH 2.0 will be defined as ultrasound money.**",1625610482,2021-07-07

&amp;#x200B;

That is not a given. I was hostile to Nick Johnson, a person who blocked my and my colleague's EIPs back in March of 2019. I hope you do not ask a victim to forget the abuse just on the chance that the abuser changed character. Reality proved me right: he is very much the abuser he once was. How the weiroll team and others aligned themselves behind this new abuse... That is on them. Mr. Christian Tzurcanu and me were right to not give anew the benefit of the doubt.  


  
\&gt; ""I'm not getting paid to write weiroll, I'm doing it on my own time as a volunteer as well, I'll never get paid for it or accept bounties or grants for it because that's stupid"" 

&amp;#x200B;

That is the reason I have a duty to try to recover you from the association with volunteer abusers. But:   
1. you cannot guarantee that the whole team shares those values nor that you will continue to do so.   
2. even as volunteer: there are 2 main kinds of volunteers: one who volunteers more (as effort) then the income received from other sources and the other who volunteers only as to give-back something. I would need to know which are you. You know which one I am.  
3. being a volunteer does not guarantee that you will not abuse and mock other volunteers  
If you are a volunteer, we invite you warmly to add your name to:   
https://github.com/the-higher-ethereum/the-higher-ethereum   


  
\&gt; ""Regarding the censoring, deleting abusive messages that are misleading and not on topic that are on \*our\* repo is not censoring.""

Please produce the abusive message and explain in what way truth abuses your repo. The issue was inviting you to cite prior work and to contribute back.

&amp;#x200B;

  
\&gt; ""The github issues is also not the place for that - it's not relevant to the project at all"" 

&amp;#x200B;

maybe not to your project, but it relevant to the principles of open source. And the place for that information was on your repo if your repo respects the said principles. Or maybe your project now finds that the right place for it is not github?
