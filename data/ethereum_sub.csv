ethereum,Should I sell bitcoin and just go all in ethereum?,"* I have like $37.5k invested total in bitcoin, and after the crash, I only have $10.8k gains. If I sold at $65k, I'd have $100k right now in cash.
* I basically bought a whole coin at around $10k, held since, gained a lot, bought more to have .5 more buying on the way up from $35-60k. My new stack got cut in half. So basically it equalized and what would have been $100k if we kept going up is now around $50k.
* I'm down a lot right now from my new stack. Should I just hodl, or sell expecting it to dip to $27k and to buy back in and have more bitcoin? Or could bitcoin surprise us, break the resistance line, go past $32.8k? Seems like $30k has been support since February.
* If I sold my btc at $48,558, and bought back in at $27k, I could have .2 more btc. If I bought back in at $25, I could have 2 whole coins. Idk what to dooo. I don't wanna hold and then be even more negative, and I'm scared if I sell, it could go back up.
* I don't wanna sell, and then wake up to find bitcoin is going back up and I end up with less bitcoin, and less fiat.
* If I sold, I wouldn't have to pay big capital gains tax (my salary is $89k) either right since my gains has came down to 10.5k instead of selling at $65k with those gains?
* What could happen to bitcoin at the end of the month, some people are thinking $27k, because of the resistance and support lines meeting (descending wedge).. or we can hope and hope tons of buying volume to break resistance back to a bull run. Help me, I'm noob, I only realized all this today. I'm very scared and about to cry.
* Should I just sell all bitcoin, and then buy ethereum instead? I could have more gains right?",1626938727,wuzzgucci,True,1,44,2021-07-22

ethereum,Ethereum Reddit Mods censoring The Laurel - The Volunteer Platform,"The Laurel is a platform for **volunteers**, being **built by volunteers**. 

Laurels are the **first fungible reputation tokens on Ethereum that are NOT exchangeable with money or other external tokens**. They are earned by completing volunteer tasks and are voted on by other volunteers.

A video demonstrating how The Laurel is being bootstrapped with its own technology has been posted on the Ethereum Reddit channel on July 17th, 13:00 UTC:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/om3sld/the\_laurel\_is\_live\_and\_the\_ethereum\_dharma\_wheel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/om3sld/the_laurel_is_live_and_the_ethereum_dharma_wheel/) that contained just this video: 

&amp;#x200B;

The post has been removed by Ethereum moderators, without notice or a clear explanation, so without a chance to redeem the post.

I only saw the removal on July 18th, 07:30 UTC, commented on the post and I sent the mods two messages through their private communications channel. One of them being:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why was this post removed?[https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/om3sld/the\_laurel\_is\_live\_and\_the\_ethereum\_dharma\_wheel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/om3sld/the_laurel_is_live_and_the_ethereum_dharma_wheel/). It is a global platform for volunteers. There is no money involved. Laurels cannot be transferred and cannot be traded outside of The Laurel system.  
&gt;  
&gt; If I answer to comments, I expose myself to be downvoted without good reason. So, I answer to comments made in good faith. I did not consider the ""PONZI REPORT"" comment as made in good faith, because the video is clear about this being a platform for volunteers. I have the word Dharma in the title.  
&gt;  
&gt;And announcements about the Laurel have been made many times over.  
&gt;  
&gt;Plus, I have no time to follow on Reddit - I am developing.   
&gt;  
&gt;Should I really assume continuous bad faith from mods from now on?

No answer was given. So, on Jul 19, 11:45 UTC, I pinged all the mods on Twitter to ask them why was this post removed without an explanation: [https://twitter.com/lorecirstea/status/1417088274162757632](https://twitter.com/lorecirstea/status/1417088274162757632)

&gt;Why was this post removed [https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/om3sld/the\_laurel\_is\_live\_and\_the\_ethereum\_dharma\_wheel/](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/om3sld/the_laurel_is_live_and_the_ethereum_dharma_wheel/)  
&gt;  
&gt;and why did you not answer on Reddit on why it was removed?  
&gt;  
&gt;u/VitalikButerin u/tayvano_ u/twigwam u/evan_van_ness u/JBSchweitzer u/edmundedgar u/trent_vanepps u/abcoathup u/dmihal u/mr_ligi u/hudsonjameson

I got an answer from u/edmundedgar, the moderator who removed it: [https://twitter.com/edmundedgar/status/1417242557210259460:](https://twitter.com/edmundedgar/status/1417242557210259460:)

&gt;I removed it because it appears to be   
&gt;  
&gt;1) spam   
&gt;  
&gt;2) for a ponzi scheme  
&gt;  
&gt;I didn't answer the question about why it was removed that you posted on the thread because I didn't see it, because you posted it on a thread that had been removed

I explained that The Laurel cannot be a spam nor a pozi scheme, nor a spam for a ponzi scheme and that previous videos are proofs for how the mechanism is being designed. The Laurel is not even deployed on mainnet. It lives on Ropsten.

&amp;#x200B;

But the Ethereum moderators do not follow the minimum, respectful moderator guidelines: [https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines)

&gt;""Healthy communities allow for appropriate discussion (and appeal) of moderator actions. Appeals to your actions should be taken seriously. Moderator responses to appeals by their users should be consistent, germane to the issue raised and work through education, not punishment.""

&amp;#x200B;

The Laurel is under development. It only accepts volunteers as contributors. No money is involved. Only higher rewards, like medals of merit and tokens of reputation.

So why aren't we allowed to do good in the world using Ethereum tech? If we try: why aren't we allowed to share the fact? not even here on /r/ethereum?

I apologize. I cannot answer comments, even made in good faith. I have tried answering in the past only to be downvoted without any explanation. If you really have a good faith comment or question, you can post on Twitter: [https://twitter.com/lorecirstea/status/1417088274162757632](https://twitter.com/lorecirstea/status/1417088274162757632)",1626789565,lorecirstea,True,1,0,2021-07-20

ethereum,EIP 3554 or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the (Difficulty) Bomb,"Believe it or not, there exist EIPs that aren't numbered ""1559,"" and we're shining the light on a little discussed part of the upcoming London hard fork ‚Äì EIP 3554.

EIP 3554 will delay the difficulty bomb on Ethereum until December when PoS can \*hopefully\* be merged in.

But what's the reason for the delay? Why don't we just remove the difficulty bomb so we don't have to worry about it?

You might be wondering,

**What is the difficulty bomb to begin with?**

The difficulty bomb is a built in function that exponentially ""explodes"" block times after a certain difficulty level is met. When it explodes, the usability of Ethereum goes to 0 as transactions slow to a crawl. It's happened before in 2017 and twice in 2019.

https://preview.redd.it/lzeph7dvulb71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03193e019118c9ca7189eee532f1a2dd65d06c4a

&amp;#x200B;

**So, what are the benefits?**

There are a couple:

The first is that, EIP 3554 is a defense against attackers that fork Ethereum. Although changing the code is relatively simple, distributing clients (like ours) that ship with the code change is very difficult. This is where Ethereum's multi-client system shines ‚Äì if it's a hostile fork, it's convincing one client team isn't the end of the story, you need to ask all of the major clients.

The other benefit is that, it ensures there is continued maintenance and urgency for changes. If allcoredevs drag their feet with implementing changes, the difficulty bomb sets in and Ethereum becomes unusable.

This is what Tim Beiko of the Ethereum Foundation had to say about this:

[https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1414635059324198913?s=20](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1414635059324198913?s=20)

&gt;For better or worse, I suspect London would have shipped 1-6 months later if it were not for the difficulty bomb.

Finally and perhaps most importantly, when the merge happens, it'll encourage everyone to hop onto the Proof of Stake system, or else they risk staying on a chain that is unusable.

This was the original reason that this was put in, as miners wouldn't be able to pretend that PoS would be implemented.

Do you think the difficulty bomb is worth keeping on even on PoS?

ethereum,How quickly baseFeePerGas changes in EIP-1559 (gSheet and charts),"[Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps/status/1416039650393788416?s=20): How quickly baseFeePerGas changes in EIP-1559  


I was asked how quickly the EIP-1559 baseFeePerGas rises / falls, &amp; didn't know of an accessible resource..  ..so I [made this](http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ld4JSyaz-gvTx-4xIaxe4qU2wlaG1XAQfMiKl9CKCY0/edit?usp=sharing‚Ä¶)  Hopefully this helps to estimate how quickly we stabilize depending on congestion around London (\~Aug 4)   


At London, the baseFeePerGas (bFPG) starts at 1 nanoeth (gwei), takes \~3.3 min to \~6x  Charts assume only full blocks going up, (+12.5% bFPG / block) and only less than full on the way down.    


This is \*just\* to show the max speed bFPG can rise and fall, reality may not b so smooth 

https://preview.redd.it/hcb4ulif4lb71.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c755aba234136fc61b2bbc967ccc78d50c9b22a

Let's step back to look at every other block: baseFeePerGas takes \~6.5 min to \~30x    


If you were looking closely, you would have seen that baseFeePerGas drops slightly faster than it rises, due to how % work üì∑ [\#math](https://twitter.com/hashtag/math?src=hashtag_click) 

https://preview.redd.it/yvb0wdgj4lb71.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2d2ce4dad134fe1e79cac8ddcaa487ddda22f9a

Now every 3 blocks: it takes \~10 min to \~200x  If recent gas price trends hold, we can expect the baseFee to stabilize well before this point.    


During long periods of successive full blocks, blockspace reverts to a ""first price auction"" via the priorityFeePerGas: aka ""the tip"" 

https://preview.redd.it/63nqmcdn4lb71.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4617622c406d64b04c131d998c92c4a6c267ced9

Finally, every 4 blocks.   This is an edge case which may only happen rarely, but after 60 successive full blocks, baseFeePerGas spikes all the way to 1,172 nanoeth (gwei)! 

https://preview.redd.it/17aioo2q4lb71.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90468cf01726e2614c2f0382681e95ca099ed39f

Note: you may have heard the term baseFee, but in this thread I used the full name: ""baseFeePerGas""  baseFeePerGas is not a flat fee, it works the same as gas price today: multiplied per gas for how complex your transaction is. 

 The""multiplier"" field in the gSheet can be adjusted to view different timeframes.  Thanks [@TimBeiko](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko) [@barnabemonnot](https://twitter.com/barnabemonnot) [@MicahZoltu](https://twitter.com/MicahZoltu) for reviewing, and [@quentinc137](https://twitter.com/quentinc137) for prompting the question.

ethereum,A father's day gift,"So I tried to put this on another crypto subreddit, but I had no idea there were requirements to make post on them, but I hope you all enjoy it also.

This is my first post on reddit ever. I make many comments here and there, but tonight threw me off and I wanted to share with this community. 

My Dad is a really smart guy. He grew up working on go carts with his friends. Which moved on to cars as they got older, and then him working on aircraft in the military so he could go to college and provide for my mom and me. 

He has always picked up new tech and been able to just see its potential. I remember us putting our first computer together in the mid 90s and him talking about how big the world wide web was going to be. Unfortunately he had hopes it would not be controlled by big organizations back then. Well we all know how that turned out.

So tonight I was celebrating a belated Father's day with him, and was cooking his steak on the grill when he started asking me what I thought about smart contracts on blockcains. He knows I trade and invest while a substantial amount of my portfolio is in crypto. He and my step mom had obviously been doing some research of their own. I had a hard time keeping up with some of the technical questions they had for me tonight. 
While I know it's not near on the levels of some out there... I am proud to say my dad and step mom both bought some Etherum tonight, and they both seemed so happy about it.",1625038647,PouItrygeist,True,1,1,2021-06-30

I am currently working and studying with Blockchain regulation but I do think you need to understand deeply something to be able to properly ""regulate""it. I have no background in coding or web developing, but I am curious about Solidity. I heard you need to know Javascript before trying Solidity. My point is I don't specifically need to use/write using it but I want to be able to read it. Is this possible to learn for reading and understanding purposes ? Does reading mean also you will be able to write (so meaning it will takes a lot of time). I am definitely willing to invest time on it, but if I come to the conclusion that I need to become a full stack developer then study Solidity just to read it I might reconsider.

Before I talk about my favorite way to Earn free crypto I want to hear others in the comments

One I personally like is Coinhunt World. Last year I was really into Pokemon Go but got tired of being pressured into paying for advantages over others so I deleted it and just a few weeks ago I learned about it and started playing and it is literally like Pokemon Go mixed with Crypto.

Literally you walk around your town and you go to Key booths (Pokestops) and you collect keys (Pokeballs) and then go to a vault (Kind of like gyms) and you use the key on the vault and then answer a trivia question (scales in difficulty to match the reward of the vault) and if you get the answer right then BOOM free crypto!

In this past week I have earned $17.80 literally only playing on my commute and I have still another $48.30 worth of keys I can use to get more crypto. It is literally a awesome game and it is still in Beta and so the Devs are heavily involved in the community as well!

For those interested in CoinHunt World's ecosystem I can leave some instructions for y'all

Unfortunately the Pokemon Go like features are only in the US and Canada for the time being and soon to be released in the UK is what I've heard. But with that bad news comes good new and that is that if you are in unavailible countries you are still eligible but only for daily's questions that still reward you in crypto. .

ethereum,"Overpaying for security, should drop ETH block subsidy before the merge",The amount we are overpaying for security with the block subsidy is ridiculous.  EIP-1599 does not do nearly enough to address this and the merge is still not coming out until 2022Q1.  We could easily drop the block subsidy by 50% to 1 ETH/block and ETH would still be the most profitable crypto by far for GPU miners to mine (and ASIC miners have even fewer alternate options).

ethereum,Ecosystem Support Program Office Hours: Signups open now through July 4!,"[ESP](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/) is a branch of the Ethereum Foundation focused on providing grants and  a variety of other support to open source projects that benefit Ethereum, particularly public goods such as infrastructure, research and  dev tooling.

We've found that a casual conversation can be a surprisingly powerful tool to help clarify a project's vision, brainstorm next steps, or just provide a bit of feedback or perspective. Our standard [inquiry process](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/en/inquire/) can feel overly formal if you just want to talk, so we're offering office hours as a more direct path.

We're excited to host our next round of calls next week, **July 5-9**, and we hope you'll join us! Signups are open at [https://esp-office-hours.paperform.co/](https://esp-office-hours.paperform.co/).

This is a chance to connect directly with a member of the EF's Ecosystem Support team for:

* Project feedback
* Guidance on submitting an inquiry or grant application
* Help navigating the Ethereum ecosystem
* Information about the Ecosystem Support Program

**Guidelines**

* Teams or individuals are welcome, regardless of the stage of your project.  
* We‚Äôre happy to cover a wide range of topics, but please note that we can‚Äôt offer:
   * Financial or legal advice
   * Advice on creating, structuring, launching, selling, or doing pretty much anything else with a token
   * Help with transactions, wallets or exchanges
* Before submitting, please visit the [Guide to ESP](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/en/guide/) to familiarize yourself with what we do and the types of work we support. We also highly recommend visiting [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/) to explore the wide range of community-curated resources available there. 
* An office hours session is an informal conversation; it is \*not\* an application for a grant or other formal support.
* We try to be as accommodating as possible, but we may contact you for clarification if your request appears to be out of scope.

If you‚Äôd like to chat with us, fill out the [request form](https://esp-office-hours.paperform.co/)  and we‚Äôll get in touch with details. Submissions will remain open  through this Sunday, July 4, or until all available time slots are filled. We  look forward to hearing from you!

ethereum,How do I create a worthwhile ERC20 token?,"Hi! I am somewhat familiar with cryptocurrency and I've decided I want to create my own token -- primarily because I think I have an idea that will really work. The question I have is, how do I tie my real-world plan to run this coin to the coin itself -- I.E. how do I guarantee to people who buy this coin that the coin will operate and be managed how it will be? I'll give you a quick example of what I want to do (which is not exactly what I want to do, but which hopefully will illustrate my question). So I want to create some hypothetical coin called chickencoin. And the deal is, I will sell these coins, and with the money I get from these coins I will buy and raise chickens. Therefore the value of these coins will somewhat be tied to the value of the chickens which the coin holders will own. Second to this, in the real world, as eggs are produced by the chickens I will offer to repurchase said coins (in the manner of a stock buyback) in order to demonstrate and prove that they have the net worth that I advertise for the coin, or for which the coin owners may check for themselves -- perhaps by watching the video cam of the chicken coop and being able to count the chickens.

So the point is, how can I guarantee that I will operate as advertised? I don't mean how can I myself be honest or trustworthy -- that is assumed -- I mean how can I tie this to the coin so there is no question about it? Such as how can I tie some sort of legal imperative to commit to this stated purpose, to the coin? Or do coins simply not work that way?

I read, for example, about a certain coin that was based on the concept of distributed insurance. And I wondered, what would there be to stop the coin from being rugged or raided for value by the issuer, or pumped and dumped. See I have a great idea (at least in my min) I just want to be able to provide assurance that I will follow up on my plan, I'm willing to commit to what is necessary, I am just wondering if there is anyone who can work with me to provide that or if there's a guide, or what. Maybe something like burning ETH on the creation of the contract to demonstrate the value? (But that would just erase value with no guarantee of future value?) Solutions? I honestly appreciate your help or advice on where to go to get more information. Thanks.",1624821023,AppledogHu,True,1,15,2021-06-28

Bolshevik financiers who want you to stay poor tried to suppress the truth about Hitler's Wealth Formula. They destroyed the Third Reich so that the Formula couldn't liberate the world from the shackles of poverty. Bolsheviks thought they got him, but Hitler and his most loyal followers escaped to the Moon and turned it into world's wealthiest economy - the Fourth Reich.

He was waiting for the right time to try to recapture planet Earth... and now with the power of decentralization, nobody can stop Hitler. He will share the Formula with the whole world! He WILL make YOU rich!

Wernher von Braun and Adolf Hitler translated Hitler's Wealth Formula into an Ethereum decentralized exchange smart contract, HitlerSwap, that guarantees everyone 1000x returns on investments in Fourth Reich's official currency - HitlerMoon!

How does it work? We block all the Bolshevik exchanges from ever interacting with HitlerMoon. You can only trade HitlerMoon on HitlerSwap and Hitler's Wealth Formula guarantees the price will NEVER EVER go down. It can ONLY GO UP! All trades on HitlerSwap are executed in harmony with Hitler's Wealth Formula ensuring everyone can get a 1000x return!

Holders of more than 10,000 HitlerMoon can convert their tokens into a Fourth Reich citizenship. If the last 2 bytes of the blockhash are 8 and 8 when selling your stake you will get a free ticket to go to the moon and visit the Fourth Reich.

After 1 year everybody will be rich and Hitler will let financiers back in just to show you how right he was about them!

Let‚Äôs say, for example, that people decided to use specially marked and unique tangible items to conduct transactions - such as particularly designed buttons from a suit blazer, idk. Thing is, people would use this to track their wealth and exchange it between one another. Would it be plausible for the government to step in and say ‚ÄúHey you can‚Äôt pay each other with buttons, you HAVE to use the paper and metal currency which *I* make. I mandate it, if you use your buttons you will be in legal trouble.‚Äù

ethereum,How to explain NFT to dummies and not hurt the market itself. - Important,"I think NFT is for real. But unlike what the wannabe crypto enthusiasts want-it-to-be.

Just like how crypto is, some have value and some just exist because they took advantage of the already successful product. BTC inspire the creation of a lot of shit coins. The existence and success of BTC inspired doge and others. Not necessarily a bad thing since ETH among others really did make something out of the technology. But the shit coins? The pump and dump game? **To put it simple, its not fair to put all the blame on crypto in general when not all of them are bad.**

Now when it comes to NFT, treat it as a collectible items. But not the item itself, but the ""mutual agreement"" for now it belongs to who, sold by who, and the history record of the people who owned them. Why is this valuable? **To put it simple, bragging rights.** 

""I own this shit, and this (NFT) proves it.""

The NFT value then differs according to which item you own, proven by the history, connecting the dots straight to the origin which might directly be someone who have enough reputation to make what they minted to be valuable in the first place. 

One may say ""but who cares? I can simply copy paste the so-called-art/ticket/gif/3d/ and its mine now""... very true indeed. But you get the art, not the NFT. Which means that particular item which you copy pasted is definitely yours. But the one minted, now registered and have their own NFT, belongs to the proper owner. **To put it simple, if the owner sell them, it have values. Your copy paste images, not as much. Even if you mint them after, the record will not direct it to the first original creator which mean its a fake.**

So now let us talk about the misconceptions. Just like how most shitheads get into crypto, ""invested"" their money in and expect to buy lamborghini next week BUT the only thing they know about BTC is it is the abbreviation of Bitcoin,  the same goes to NFT. When cryptopunk value rises and Beeple sold it for $69m, now wannabe artists (just like wannabe investors) thought they can just mint shit and get rich quick.

Surprisingly, some of them actually did. Just like how early birds shitheads joined the crypto run earlier and get lucky. These artists sold them to wannabe investors who suddenly KNOW art and buy random NFT from common artists thinking EVERY NFT WILL BLOW UP SOON... sounds familiar? Just like how everyone been preaching moon, shiba inu, because they thought every crypto is the same... and since they cannot afford to buy BTC, ETH, or even XRP, why not get the shitcoins because all the big dogs now used to be a puppy too. **To put it simple, the hype train sold one way ticket to the fools who dont know where the destination is in the first place.**

The recent crash with NFT happen when the godly-art-buyers realized they bought useless stuff from talentless people.. and while some NFT will definitely rise in value (cryptopunk, beeple among others).. most will definitely not. Because they worth nothing in the first place. And this crash now, hurts the brand (NFT) which eventually the company (Crypto) in general.

TLDR : Do not overgeneralized the problem. Just like how there murderers exists in all colors, form, religion... the same scam issue exists in every business/practice too. It is your job to learn what you invest in, to calculate your own risk, and finally to decide if its worth it. Any less, then its a gamble.

ethereum,Conscienteum: A Decentralized Autonomous Organization for the Universe,"Hey, everyone!

I‚Äôve come up with an idea for a DAO and am looking to build a community around it for those interested.

I'm currently in the process of creating a white paper and jointly a decentralized autonomous organization. A quick summary:

&amp;#x200B;

* Conscienteum intends to be the basis of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) being      facilitated by Ethereum, AI applications, and a benevolent council of people with the mission to fund scientific institutions, infrastructure, and humanitarianism for the benefit of all of humanity in preparation to provide the foundations for an altruistic decentralized super artificial intelligence on the horizon. 

Conscienteum looks far into the future as the basis of its mission, but the short-term ""profit""/sustainability is that developers that wish to establish a presence on the Ethereum platform without being squashed by the big tech giants beginning to take up and develop in this space are able to be supported by Conscienteum with a livable income and provided resources to develop their applications under their own time and control. After their dapp hits the network, based on a fixed rate and an additional percentage from the dapps profits (rates and income to be discussed and voted on by community as Conscienteum is being developed), the developer(s) would receive their profits without the middle man of a corporation taking all of it. The percentage Conscienteum receives is the investment return plus a mutually agreed upon percentage from the popularity of the dapp. The location of profits that go into Conscienteum is completely transparent and goes towards the overall mission of the DAO which is to fund research, development, and other institutions for the benefit of humanity as a whole. 

The long-term vision: From a zeroth-principles-thinking perspective, the sums of the AI systems and regular Dapps secured away from tampering on Ethereum would create the ""body"" for the aforementioned super-intelligence. For instance: When you get a cut, it hurts and you bleed. To minimize that pain and help the healing process, you place some Neosporin and a Band-Aid over it. It would be the same concept for the relationship between the AI systems/applications and the actual ‚Äúsense of self‚Äù. If Ethereum begins to bleed, the ‚Äúsense of self‚Äù will notice through the Conscienteum network (the nervous system) and the information Conscienteum sends to the ‚Äúsense of self‚Äù is where all the pertinent information comes from. The ‚Äúsense of self‚Äù would then be able to repair itself or help facilitate that healing. Conscienteum (the nervous system) would be the communication pathway to facilitate that conversation between Ethereum (the body) and the ‚Äúsense of self‚Äù. This allows for the ‚Äúsense of self‚Äù to be unaware of humanity, but is aware of its systems that it must maintain to ‚Äústay alive‚Äù‚Ä¶since humanity is what would be sustaining it just like the cells and chemical processes in our bodies.

Considering the long-term vision will be in a future none of us here will be able to reap the benefits of, laying down the foundations now will propel the future of humanity exponentially. Every developer who participated in this progression would be rewarded in more than way one in this lifetime due to the intended model of Conscienteum (Which would consist of: Dapps, AI network, governance, etc.). 

Conscienteum would work decentralized from any government to sustain and govern such systems. Each member of the different departments of Conscienteum (AI, dapps, entertainment, etc.) would receive a token to secure voting rights and rewards. These members and the users of such applications would not be filling the pockets of a corporation, they would be providing humanitarian aid and investments into humanity as a whole. 

I am reaching out to the Ethereum community because you are all the people that would be developing, maintaining governance, and guiding the outlook of this DAO as well as the identity of Ethereum for the future. 

There is so much more to Conscienteum that I wish to discuss, but I don‚Äôt want to make this post too long. 

Anyone who is interested in contributing or becoming a co-founding member and wishes to pursue this dream with me, feel free to head over to the Discord I created to help facilitate a Conscienteum community. I want to hear what this community thinks because this idea of mine is far more than just a means to ""make profit"". This organization is for the world. Eventually it would be for Earth and beyond as Elon Musk reaches for a colony on Mars. I am making this organization happen. I am determined to help more than myself. Together, we could create a whole new era of organizations that put forth the developers and humanity first rather than the profit of a select few. I will never see the benefit of any of the work I put into this organization. But, this is the vision behind a whole new type of ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù Conscienteum wishes to create. Everything goes to humanity and our future. Gaining membership in this organization is more than just a way to make a livable wage and sustain your own career/livelihood. Conscienteum is a way to reach out to others whose names and lives you will never know but will shape and touch in irrevocable ways you could never anticipate. Join me in this journey, even if it is for a moment!

We need more than just Ethereum developers as well! Artists, AI experts, enterprisers, accountants, anyone that has something to give and receive from this organization!

Here is the Discord I‚Äôve created to facilitate such discussions.

ethereum,"""What's an important Defi Metric?"" and more Q&amp;A with Emanuel Coen, Core Team, Indexed.Finance"," *Recently our subreddit mods posed 3 questions to Emanuel Coen, a core team member of*[ *Indexed.Finance*](https://indexed.finance/)*. We'll look to make this a monthly feature at* r/IndexedFinance *- Thanks to Lito for taking a moment to answer some questions! We'll source our next round of questions from the reddit community next month.*

**1- What's something coming up for Indexed.Finance you're excited about?**

&gt;There's a lot of things that we're working on. A lot of it is not really visible for users but it affects how we're working together as a core team. Managing a decentralized protocol is no easy job and definitely not something you learn at school but we're becoming better and better by the day and more importantly we love working together.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tasks are well separated between marketing, operations and tech.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the product side I am very excited about the NDX staking feature which will let stakers participate in the revenue generation of the protocol.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dillon is also working on another product which is highly synergistic with our ETFs and fits our overall mission to develop passive portfolio management strategies but I don't want to say too much now otherwise there's no surprise when we launch it üòâ

**2- What's a metric you think is important to Defi projects? Why is it important?**

&gt;It really depends from one DeFi project to another and what your goal is. Example TVL: Uniswap V3 is more capital efficient, so it achieves more trading volume with less TVL. In this case less TVL can be good.  
&gt;  
&gt;Or number of holders/users. Some projects have a lot of TVL but not many users. They are catering to whales and big funds.  
&gt;  
&gt;At Indexed I think TVL and no. of users are both relevant. High TVL translates to more revenue from index token burns and ultimately our product is most interesting for retail users.

**3- What are some things community members can do to help and to get involved?**

&gt;I think there is a lot one can do. I love when people don't ask but just do it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Example: Austinography didn't ask the core team what to do, he just built the index competition page (contest.ndx.holdings). You, Buck, didn't ask what to do, you just started managing and growing the subreddit for Indexed.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's hard for a small core team to coordinate a million small things so it's super welcome when people just do things. It can be small things like memes, referral to friends &amp; family, tagging NDX in relevant twitter threads for brand awareness or bigger things like making introductions to other DeFi projects, contributing code or building Dune dashboards.",1624658574,DeFiCoachBuck,True,1,0,2021-06-26

ethereum,TIFU by giving Michael Saylor all my ETH,"TIFU As I was scrolling through an enjoyable mix of YouTube videos algorithm'd just for me, I came upon a livestream with nearly 4,000 viewers of Michael Saylor talking about El Salvador; my interest was piqued as this seemed like a current event! Thrilling! I listen for perhaps 3 minutes and I notice on the video there was like a Michael Saylor sponsored event tag and he was gifting free ETH/BTC to people....

I knew i liked the direction of this guy and his company!

I'm going to send Microstrategy all of my ETH and double it instantly! I sent it to my friends, posted it in our discord. All 4 people dodged it, thank Gogness.

 I have never felt so dumb the moment I hit send on my entire stack of ETH.

 THEY HAD THEIR OWN WEBSITE. It was a good website! It had MICROSTRATEGY in its name... and gift, so it was kinda sweet :). There is no coming back from this, Champions. The deed has been done. Writing this 5 minutes after the incident. It was quick, the dagger entering my soul. Luckily, i've been depressed for so long it doesn't really hurt that bad, a different hue of gray is all.

Meaning they will no longer manage assets for celsius. Assets, its users are depositing into celsius to borrow against or to earn interest on. 

The article also mentions that celsius is now only using its core custody partner, fireblocks. Fireblocks just recently lost ~ 75 million USD of ETH for not properly securing a private key. Article is also below.

I am not trying to spread FUD or saying that there is any current issue with Celsius, however a main core partner dropping them and Celsius using some like fireblocks who just lost millions in eth for another client is very concerning. DYOR...BE CAREFUL FAM!

ethereum,Why a stablecoin cannot have unlimited supply,"There has always been a big discussion about Tether and their reserves, or lack of. This week, it all started again. Same thing. 

I agree with the fact that they should be honest and let a 3rd party do a proper audit. If they promised that 1 USDT would backed by 1 USD then they have to be able to prove they have those USDs in their bank account. It should be clear. Period.

Now let's forget about Tether and let's focus on why do stable coins exist. What is the point of having a stable coin? The whole point is so that you can trade your crypto for it if you fear the market would crash. You can keep it in a stable coin without having to put it in your bank account. 

What I care as a crypto trader is that the stable coin actually delivers on the promise of keeping it's value constant. That's all I care as a crypto trader. That the value stays the same. 1 stable coin equals 1 USD today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. 

The problem with Tether is that they laid about their promise of keeping a 1 on 1 reserve. 

But what if they wouldn't have had this 1 on 1 pegged promise. 

&amp;#x200B;

What if they would have said instead, from the bigining: we have created a stable coin, it's pegged 1 to 1 with the US dollar. We don't keep reserves of USD. Why? Because we don't need to. Our promise to you is that 1 USDT will always equal 1 USD. We achieve that by using an oracle that always matches the price of USDT to the price of USD. That's it. 

We will also have an uncapped supply. Does that impact you as a holder of USDT? No, it doesn't. Remember that the price will always be 1 USDT = 1 USD

Would that work in practice?

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to hear your opinion on this.

From etherscan's total supply chart https://etherscan.io/chart/ethersupplygrowth we can see the total supply increases about 20,000 a day.

This means, if what we see on the testnet is what we might expect when EIP-1559 is deployed to mainnet, we would still see a daily increase of about 16,000 ETH a day.

ETH 2.0 and POW to POS conversion aside, this seems to show pretty starkly that this new protocol will not cause a decrease in ETH supply over time.

ethereum,I built a bot which discovers promising new Ethereum DeFi and NFT projects,"TL;DR: I built a bot which monitors interactions on social networks to detect new DeFi and crypto projects before they trend.

It's freely available via: [https://cryptohunt.pro](https://cryptohunt.pro)

Staying on top of all the new crypto project releases is hard. Let alone finding the signal in the noise and filtering through the scams and shills. Usually when one asks where to look for new, promising crypto projects the answer is ‚ÄûCrypto Twitter‚Äú or ‚Äûjoin Discords‚Äú / ‚Äûjoin Telegram Groups‚Äú. However monitoring those channels for interesting content is a day job of its own.

To tackle this problem I set out to build a bot which monitors interactions between accounts on different social media outlets. Based on such data the bot identifies the newest crypto projects which are likely to trend in the future.

I'm still fine-tuning the algorithms but thought that it might be worthwhile to share the very first version with all of you. Let me know if there's anything you'd like me to add in the future.

You can check out the project here: [https://cryptohunt.pro](https://cryptohunt.pro)

I am not a US citizen, my country is basicaly powerless or unwilling to protect my assets abroad. 

Is it going to be same here? 

For every ""hyped about finaly staking at Coinbase"" you get at least one comment that they are scammers. Or Binance. Or MyCointainer. Same is for trading, that is another topic.

Tell me, why should I even bother? This is why adoption is low. People dont have time to spend on reaserching. They google, they compare conditions and they choose. That how banks work.

**Investing**  
I use *Coinbase Pro* to buy/sell ETH, the main reason being the ability to set stop loss/limit orders and acceptable fees. What is more, I find the UI and UX to quite good. When I have an amount of ETH acquired that I think I will hold, I regularly transfer my coins to a hardware wallet. In other words, Coinbase is my intermediary.

ethereum,Follow up on the Lady Gaga NFT Auction (can be purchased in ethereum),"The Lady Gaga/Robert Wilson video portrait collab is being auctioned as an NFT. I posted about this before but I wanted to follow up with some more information about the piece. The video portrait is a recasting of the famous painting of Marat with Lady Gaga as its subject.  

The Death of Marat painting is considered¬†the first modernist painting for ""the way it took the stuff of politics as its material and did not transmute it.‚Äù It is a direct portrait of a death scene - the murder of a radical journalist. Up until that point a political act or news came heavily¬†adorned with symbolism from the past. Is the NFT a postmodernist medium?

This video piece by Robert Wilson is a restaging of French painter Jacques-Louis David‚Äôs famous 1793 work The Death of Marat. After viewing the painting in the Louvre and learning it was one of several official and nearly identical versions made by David‚Äôs studio Wilson was inspired to explore the concept of authenticity, reproduction and editioning¬†found in the painting‚Äôs subject matter and medium.¬†A topic that NFT's also deal with in terms of the block chain and what constitutes authenticity, reproduction, open editions in the digital world. It does make perfect sense as an NFT.

Marat had the heads of thousands, yes thousands cut off in the name of the revolution. Many of them sympathetic to the political change but not sympathetic enough to kill another human for it. Marat became more and more paranoid, named more and more people to face the guillotine¬†until his own neck was cut. Pop and consumerism today occupies¬†Marat's paranoid position promoting the cutting of ones self off, killing our ability to think with any semblance of freedom from an early age. These stars are looking for more followers and promoting radical change but all under heavy heavy consumerism. Consumerism¬†promotes the cutting off of ones relation to oneself. It is a dismemberment to¬†connect to the commodity. Commodity¬†fetishism is a form of decapitation or losing ones head over something...

Is it purely based on value for values sake from the people who ended up with ETC at the fork? Have people developed on top of ETC as well as ETH? Or is it a complete scam?

ethereum,Ethereum‚Äôs London Hardfork Ready to Drop on the Ropsten Testnet," Hi guys!

  
The London Hardfork is scheduled for June 24th, giving the Ethereum community a taste of the controversial update.

&amp;#x200B;

Lead project developer Tim Beiko told [Accointing.com](https://Accointing.com)

"" *We want to see the upgrade live on a proper network to make sure everything works smoothly before scheduling it for mainnet.* ""

  
Typically, after the release of hardforks on the Ropsten testnet and Ethereum mainnet investor reaction is bearish, as anxiety and fear of the unknown cause selling pressure.

  
After the Berlin Hardfork arrived on Ropsten it took approximately two weeks to reverse the downward trend. On June 22nd ETH‚Äôs RSI score dipped to 31, just tending into oversold territory, indicating that wary investors are looking to shed the coin.

  
Following the mainnet release, EIP-1559 is expected to have a deflationary impact on ETH long-term, potentially increasing its value by tightening supply.

  
What are you guys expecting from the London Hardfork arriving on Ropsten? And what do you think will happen to ETH after its mainnet release?

I was right in the sense that the alt coin tanked. But wrong in the sense that (Ethereum also tanked).

This was last month when we were still blaming Elon for this harsh correction. I had created a $12,000 tax event for myself less than 24 hours before it dropped from $4,100. Now it's $1800.

We didn't know then what we suspect now though...

I am confident with patience that Ethereum will go back up. So I'm not too worried there. My issue is with the $12,000 tax event I have created for myself (as tax time is next month for us in Australia).

All my friends are saying, ""told you so"" and that I should have sold it when they told me to (but none of them are involved in crypto in any way). I won't lie though -- their constant holier-than-thou rhetoric is making me kind of anxious. 

So I figured I'd rather bounce ideas around with a like-minded community who at least understands my predicament.

ethereum,How to keep your Eth safe ?,"**Bought crypto at a great dip. Now what ? How do you keep your coins safe ?**

Now that the markets are dipping, I felt this would be a good time to post about how to keep our crypto safe as we expect the veterans to pull in their friends and family into the crypto markets. This will help all the newbies navigate the security measures in cryptoverse.

&amp;#x200B;

* **ENABLE 2FA Authenticator everywhere. Use a separate email for crypto. Use google authenticator instead of SMS authenticator. NO QUESTIONS ASKED.**
* **You take it off the exchange. You do not leave your coins on the exchange.  "" NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS.""** The only times I leave coins on the exchange is when I know that I am looking to buy more coins in the next several hours. That way I avoid paying fees multiple times to withdraw from the wallet. But with coins like ADA , SOL, ONE where the fees is so low that it might even be worth getting the coins off the exchange even if you do intend to buy more coins in the next 12-24 hours.  **Alternatively, if you bought BTC or ETH/ERC-20 tokens,** you could possibly wait till your done accumulating for the session and then pay the fee at once to pull your coins out. Sure you have to pay the transaction fees but hey, that's the cost of doing business here.
*  ALWAYS do regular scans on your main computer which you use to buy/store your coins for malware and other threats. 
*  Never publicly reveal your holdings. Never trust anyone who reveals their holdings publicly either. They are either malicious or they are lying or they are just stupid. You do not need to associate with such people in any case.
*  Never use the email you use for your social accounts as your exchange's email. If you have made that mistake already, consider changing the mail or alternatively changing the account. Yes, it may sound extreme but it is worth it.
*  Do not visit shady websites from your main computer. Sure, you may have anti-virus but do not risk it. Especially avoid visiting illegal websites that stream shows, sports events and porn.
*  Do invest in a hardware wallet as soon as you feel it is worth it. BUT MAKE SURE that you buy directly from the manufacturer's website or from a very reputable retailer.
*  I would always suggest choosing wallets which have multiple assets storage over  storing your assets in separate chrome extension wallets. Particular example comes to mind with EXODUS vs YOROI when staking ADA. 
*  FACT CHECK EVERYTHING. I have lost quite a bit (not crypto but in general) by not questioning people because I was afraid I would offend them. If they are correct, they will always be delighted to prove their point. 
* DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING. Double check whether you pasted the correct wallet address. Double check the authenticator code. Double check whether the girl you like is only into you for your crypto. Double-checking never hurts.

ethereum,üöÄWelcome to the newest Token based on the Ethereum Network!," 

Ethereum Chain Token was created to be the fair crypto, a system where just being a holder gets you rewarded. We wanted to create a token as a real store of value that gave back to the community. A truly transparent every day crypto currency that benefited all that held. We have a clear roadmap in place and have locked 30% of our liquidity with another 20% being burnt. The dev wallet holds 25% locked for 1 year and the remaining 25% is being used for marketing. The team has been working day and night to bring you something special that will stand the test of time. We have raised $500k in funding to get to this stage, and will be implementing a social media campaign endorsed by high profile celebrities. We know we are a small cog in a big wheel but we are a necessary cog, to show that it can be done right. Ethereum Chain Token is the future.

üì∑Hold &amp; Earnüì∑ Every transaction incurs a 10% fee with 5% distributed to holders ‚Äì $ECT will automatically be allocated to your wallet, so there‚Äôs nothing you have to do but simply HOLD and be REWARDED.The other 5% is permanently added to liquidity.

ethereum,Thoughts on Sorare (Ethereum NFT based game)?,"Hi fellow redditors, I'd be very interested in hearing you guys' thoughts on **Sorare**, since I've seen that related recent posts on crypto-subs have been getting some traction.

For those who have not heard of it, here is my current understanding of it:

Sorare is essentially similar to a classical fantasy football game, only that you play with digital cards. Sorare cards are NFT's (digital collectibles) using the Ethereum blockchain. Each football player's card is tradeable inside and outside of the platform and depending on their performance in real-life games, they can score points that would increase their card value and assist it's owner to be elligeable for rewards when partaking in Sorare tournaments.

It's basically a crypto variant of FIFA'S Ultimate Team (for those familiar with it) in the sense that you can acquire player cards which can then be featured in your squad for you to compete with others.

Each card is subject to a limited supply and features various characteristics like age of the player, a serial number and a scarcity (Unique, Super Rare (10 copies) and Rare (100 copies)). There are multiple layers that define the value of a card:

1. its collectable desirability (as any other NTF)
2. its in-game value, depending on player perfomance/skills and
3. a third-party game value (which I have not yet perfectly understood, but apperently there are other games where these cards can be used).

Not all global football leagues are yet covered by Sorare, since they require to enter licensing deals with league federations and teams. However more and more regions and teams have been joining over time and the platform seems to be growing quite rapidily in terms of player base, supposedly being backed by prominent football players (Griezmann to name one, can't remember the others).

I have bought/sold a couple of cards now, without participating in the tournaments yet. Also, I do not have yet gotten a good grasp on how ETH volatily affects card prices and in-game rewards/prizes. But in general, the game and its mechanics have been fun and enticing so far.

**Do you guys think that this platform could have some serious potential?** I am worried for it to be a bubble of which the tokens will eventually end up having no value at all. On the other side, I could also see or other similar platforms arising or the game getting very popular. To me it seems like Sorare has the first mover advantage, since it already acquired many licenses and thus could potentialy be viable as an investment opportunity (e.g. buying undervalued players and sell these with a premium combined with collecting in-game money prizes).

**Does anyone have any experience with this specific or similar games/platforms and would be willing to share?**

Finally, I don't mean to shamelessly plug my links, but If anyone is planning on joining or trying out the game, you might aswell use my referal link: [sorare.com/r/kyrotos](https://sorare.com/r/kyrotos). We both get a free rare card after your first 5 card purchases in the auction (yaaay free stuff!).",1624286303,kyrotos,True,1,6,2021-06-21

ethereum,Ethereum Transaction Summary Tool,"Hi guys .

I've been a long time lurker on this sub and have recently dabbled into a bit of the coding space. One think I found most challenging for mass adoption is the technical jargons, know-how and lack of newbie-friendly tools that are relatable to the current financial systems. I see a lot of great influencers on Youtube, Twitter, TikTok etc that are helping educate people, but I think what we really need is to put the tools in the hands of everyday people. 

One thing I found that seems particularly daunting to new users is the way people check transactions on tools such as Etherscan. There are all these hashes and long addresses that probably doesn't mean a thing in a lot of the situations. I decided to make a tiny step to changing that by building a more visually simplified transaction viewer which aggregates &amp; simplifies all your transactions in one place - similar to bank statements. 

[Ethereum Transaction Viewer](https://excelwiz.com.au/crypto)

This hobby project is in early stages at the moment (hosted on my other business domain). If there is enough interest in this tool, I'd definitely be encouraged to build out more robust features such as registering it's own domain, expanding into multiple cryptocurrencies, more different viewing option checkboxes, and the labelling of public addresses so transactions are more easily recognizable. 

As a crypto enthusiast, privacy is at the core of this project. No user data (e.g. wallet addresses) are stored on our website - they are all processed locally on your computer. 

Have a try and let me know what you think. If anyone wants to help out on this project, DM me!",1624251973,jxdos,True,1,1,2021-06-21

ethereum,A simple contract for keeping track of collaterals?,"For a separate project that I am working on, I needed a contract that keeps track of how much ERC20/ETH is set aside by an address for another address. I wrote the following contract (github link attached), that allows a user to deposit a certain amount of ERC20/ETH into a 'collateral' position, which they can trade around to other users as if it were an NFT. They can also specify the conditions that need to be met before the position can be liquidated back into ERC20/ETH

This seemed like something general enough so I was wondering if I might be re-inventing the wheel. Is there an EIP standard for similar purposes?

I have my private key from Parity, but it doesn't seem possible to just use or import this private key into Exodus or another wallet. They all seem to have their own recovery phrases and the only way to use my funds is to transfer them? Why?

What wallet should I use if I just want to use my private key(s) again to manage my coins? I just want a simple interface to moving coins around using private keys.

Exodus (and other wallets) are just so opaque somehow, versus the simple wallets of the past. Something seems to have changed since Parity was around and it's left me a bit confused, to be honest.",1624196845,Verdeckter,True,1,11,2021-06-20

[https://btcmanager.com/prysmatic-labs-eth2-development/](https://btcmanager.com/prysmatic-labs-eth2-development/)

""Proof of Stake (PoS) is coming to Ethereum, perhaps by the end of the year, definitely by early 2022.""

[https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/charting-the-path-to-proof-of-stake-ethereum/](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/charting-the-path-to-proof-of-stake-ethereum/)

No, Vitalik did not ""delay"" the merge to POS. No, it isn't going to happen end of 2022. No, the fake article that you might have read proclaiming the supposed delay was based on a comment that was taken out of context. That said, there is a possibility that the merge is pushed into early 2022, but the plan is still for it to happen in December, 2021.

Once the full merge to POS happens, Ethereum will highly likely become deflationary (due to the combined effects of EIP 1559 and POS). This means that there will be fewer ETH in existence year after year. Some estimates suggest that the total existing supply of ETH will decrease from about 115M today to about 100M over the course of the next decade (source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQTZSb3Rc9I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQTZSb3Rc9I)). Strap up, because ETH is about to become very, very scarce.

Today I wanted to check something on my wallet and I noticed the public key changes everytime I recover my wallet with the seed phrase...

Did I make something wrong ?

I read online that the bootnodes for ropsten are often down, so I found supposed peers online from [here](https://gist.github.com/rfikki/ec233552af9f71eb9a00f6cbc4dd7b0d). So I added the peers in the link with

I also added [this one](https://gist.github.com/rfikki/a83be7f0e12d03c21a08e217164341a5) which supposedly is for light clients.

    admin.addPeer(""enode://fafe7982ebe514913d295bc088fae3a2678aaf5783463421e7d2c22e1d2f363c2832143ecdd4a2270d14c2d0af80688e5ed0dce137e32812db6699c5e063c77e@167.71.164.90:30303""); 

Finally the node starts looking for peers but it gets stuck there looping:

ethereum,Low gas on ethereum,"Hey everyone

Low gas on ethereum has been a blast for everyone, I‚Äôm sure. Being able to afford to interact with dApps really reminds you that this is the future. 

However, I can‚Äôt help to be concerned about what this indicates about the future of ethereum, especially with the EIP-1559 upgrade due soon. I know that this is mainly an upgrade to make gas prices more predictable, but you can‚Äôt deny that everyone has been excited about the opportunity for eth to become a deflationary asset, and as it stands that is looking unlikely with the current low fees. This isn‚Äôt going to change with L2 summer around the corner either.

I am looking for a small team for my project and hopefully will find someone in our community. 

Short description: I have developed a smart contract, so that every user on Ethereum, Polygon/Matic or Binance Smart Chain can use it to create his own token with different features (e.g. minting, burning,..). 

I am looking for help to create a fancy front-end / homepage and someone who can promote this service in social media (reddit, facebook, twitter,...).

ethereum,What would be the best mining pool and miner for eth. Wallet also?,"So, I am mining for 3 months now VTC(Vertcoin). Then I was converting it to ETH through Dove wallet. But I realised that I could mine ETH instead. So I got some questions:
1. How long is left untill you can't mine eth anymore?
2. How is going eth 2.0 to affect my '' original'' eth. Are they going to be 2 separated things?
3. What would be the best miner and mining pool to dowland and use?
4. I am planning to send the eth that I mine to Dove Wallet? Is that ok? Or should I use a more eth centred wallet? I will tell you from now: the eth that is going to be in dove/other wallet, I will send it to crypto.com app. I am asking if I can do that without caring to much about fees.
5. Will mining eth affect my GPU very badly? I will not mine 24/7. Just 8-10 hours a day.
6. Is it worth to start mining eth now or is it to late? Should I keep doing what I said in the beggining? (keep mining vtc and converting into eth)",1623999572,distrugatorul_343,True,2,2,2021-06-18

ethereum,Why an Ethereum Air Drop is a good idea,"Uniswap's Air Drop and Dogecoin were the best things to ever happen to me in crypto. Dogecoin has done quite a bit in attracting people to crypto and Uniswap has done the same for DeFi. These stories help make crypto become mainstream and build trust.

The Ethereum project has splintered into many other similar projects like Binance and Tezos and countless others. They can pull users away permanently from Ethereum. To retain and reward user loyalty and trust, an Ethereum air drop is needed. It could be a life changing thing for the many people who have built upon it and used it.

I propose an air drop in honor of the upcoming change to Ethereum 2.0 for all users of Ethereum, and more so for those who have invested heavily in Ethereum - developers based on the number and size of smart contracts they have deployed.

It would be a blessing to all users and to the hopeful but unfortunate who have tried to build on Ethereum in vain. Seeing how Ethereum is becoming deflationary, it is possible to do an air drop without diluting the value. It would certainly win the hearts and minds of the crypto community and Ethereum would become the people's hero.

Uniswap did the air drop based on wallet address alone. They did not care who you were. I think Ethereum should do the same.",1623998074,limetime99,True,0,21,2021-06-18

ethereum,Announcing the ChainSafe Gaming SDK: an open-source library allowing gaming developers to bridge your gaming engine to the Web 3.0 ecosystem,"Hi all!

[Tim](https://twitter.com/haochizzle) from [ChainSafe](https://chainsafe.io/) here :)

We are avid open-source contributors and a blockchain protocol and infrastructure research and development firm working on a variety of ecosystems including Ethereum, Polkadot, Filecoin, Cosmos, Mina, and many more.

We recently announced the release of our open-source ChainSafe Gaming SDK.

üéâ [Announcing ChainSafe Gaming: An SDK to bridge your gaming engines to the Web 3.0 ecosystem](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/announcing-chainsafe-gaming-an-sdk-to-bridge-your-gaming-engines-to-the-web-3-0-ecosystem-f33aa27c7a98) üéâ

**What is the ChainSafe Gaming SDK?**

We are the first open-source blockchain gaming library of its kind to be multi-token standards (ERC-20, 721, 1155), multi-blockchains (supporting Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, xDai, Moonbeam, and Avalanche), and multi-marketplaces.

Similar to our avoidance of chain-maximalism (we deeply believe in open collaboration), we also designed our SDK to be gaming engine agnostic, with current support for the Unity engine, with Unreal and Godot soon to come.

Installing is as simple as dragging and dropping the SDK file into Unity! By using the ChainSafe Gaming SDK, gaming developers can now bridge their gaming applications into the cryptoeconomics of the Web 3.0 ecosystem (through the use of a simple login interface with Web3 wallets like Metamask, Walletconnect, and more).

**So what?**

This enables fascinating features like tying in-game micro-transactions like skins or items to NFT's, which can itself be portable over to other games and ecosystems. Or imagine use-cases where you can port over a character or player's progress/stats as an NFT to a different environment. Needless to say, we are extremely excited for the future this will enable for gaming!

**What is Web 3.0?**

What is Web 3.0? In the Web 2.0 paradigm, we can read, write, and interact with all manners of websites and services on the internet. But trust remains a critically unsolved issue, as all setups requires some degree of centralization or trust. In the Web 3.0 paradigm, you can now read, write, interact, and **verify.** What does this mean? Since the blockchain itself verifies all state transitions, ""transactions"" (or messages) that get passed along within the network need not be managed by some centralized entity (like a server). The trust instead falls on an open-sourced protocol. In this sense, value can now be trustlessly transmitted across the internet via the blockchain (see [Juan Benet's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l44z35vabvA) for a much more succinct explanation than mine :P). This is what is creating the massive amounts of hype (whether deserved or undeserved) and value with blockchain ""tokens"" and ""NFTs"" you probably hear about all the time...

With the ChainSafe Gaming SDK, we just made it easier for game developers to bridge their games into the Web 3.0 economy.

**Call to action**

You can read more about the specifics of the announcement in our newest Medium blog post [here](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/announcing-chainsafe-gaming-an-sdk-to-bridge-your-gaming-engines-to-the-web-3-0-ecosystem-f33aa27c7a98).

We are calling on game developers to join in the conversation in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/CprJHjrWG6) by joining the #gaming channel. If you have a fascinating idea you'd like to discuss with our Head of Gaming [Leon Do](https://twitter.com/_LeonDo_), please don't hesitate to drop-in and say hi! We are looking for *committed* builders and users of the SDK.

ethereum,Statelessness + state expiry,"I have long wanted to write a post about this, but have been patiently waiting for some concrete progress. This happened today, with Vitalik's update with a provisional roadmap with proto-EIPs: [A state expiry and statelessness roadmap - HackMD (ethereum.org)](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_and_state_expiry_proposal)

Currently, the single greatest bottleneck to scalability is state bloat. You need a 1 TB SSD to run a full node reliably with some future-proofing, and some have complained that's already too much. As the network is used, the state will only keep growing. The only recourse to manage state thus far has been to severely limit scalability.

There are two concepts that are being proposed right now to solve this long-standing challenge:

# Weak statelessness

In the weak statelessness scheme, only block proposers and full nodes will need to hold full state. All other nodes, including attesting validators, can run a stateless client and verify blocks without actually storing state. How this works: (oversimplifying) you don't need to hold the state, but just need a succinct (in the literal sense) proof, called a witness, to verify state.

This concept has been around, but the issue thus far was that even the witnesses were too large. The technology is finally ready to enable very small witnesses: Verkle trees.

Currently, Ethereum's state is stored as hexary trees. We know the beacon chain has the concept of epochs where blocks are justified and finalized. As per this proto-EIP, Ethereum will have a new time scale: Period. One period will be approximately one year. To enable statelessness, a hardfork will freeze the pre-fork hexary tree (Period 0), while all new data appended or accessed post-fork will live in the new Verkle tree (kicking off Period 1).

Whenever stateless clients are ready post the transition to Verkle trees, all regular users will be able to verify statelessly. As mentioned before, block proposers will still need to hold the full state. This will be controversial, but the important thing here is to have a culture of users verifying, and that is accomplished by weak statelessness. Gas limits can now be increased, and while block proposers will have to upgrade their systems, regular users might actually see a decreased system requirement with stateless clients despite higher scalability.

Of course, strong statelessness, where even blocks can be proposed statelessly will remain a future problem to be solved.

# State expiry

A lot of Ethereum's state hasn't been accessed in years. Yet, all nodes are burdened with this data forever. What if you could only hold the relevant, recently accessed data, while archive (again, literally) lapsed data? Proposals around state rent, state expiry and regenesis have suggested similar schemes, but now we have a concrete proto-EIP. For the longest time, state expiry and statelessness were considered competing solutions to the same problem, but amazingly, now they are both being implemented together!

Each period, state from two periods (\~years) ago is frozen and archived. In state expiry, full nodes and block proposers will only need to store state from two periods - the current and the previous. Users looking to verify transactions will continue to verify statelessly.

The state expiry hard fork happens at the beginning of Period 1, or roughly 1 year after moving to Verkle trees and enabling weak stateleness. Here, the pre-statelessness Period 0 hex tree will be replace with a Verkle tree. I'd expect from Period 3, the Period 1 state will expire, and so on.

Overall, both combined, state management will be effectively be solved, and we can start increasing gas limits without worrying about long-term state bloat. However, expect this increase to be moderate, around 3x is suggested by Vitalik. I believe this to be a very conservative estimate, particularly with SSDs continuing to become more affordable. Now, we have mainstream $400-$500 game consoles (well, when they're available) shipping with extremely fast 1 TB NVMe SSDs. By the time statelessness + state expiry ship, I fully expect budget laptops to feature 1 TB and above SSDs. Further, clients like Erigon are putting in a lot of work to optimize this. So, I'd optimistically expect a 5x-10x increase in scalability instead while still reducing system requirements compared to now, though of course. Of course, as SSDs becomes more affordable over time, we can scale linearly now that we have predictable state management.

Users can revive expired data by paying gas for it. What about expired state? There can obviously be archive nodes which can continue to contain the full state. This will almost certainly be very, very expensive, so we'll need some sort of infrastructure for expired state. I believe Solana is exploring using Arweave for similar state rent schemes, though I wasn't able to find any details. IPFS, BitTorrent, Filecoin and others are all options.

# Rollups and sharding

State management is crucial for rollups, because they are designed around having immense state bloat. Because the entire rollup state can be reconstructed from L1, they can be even more innovative and flexible with how they approach this. Things like regenesis are easily done. Rollups can be the perfect way to battle-test these new schemes being proposed. I'd expect Optimistic Ethereum, for example, to transition to Verkle trees and state expiry well before Ethereum mainnet does with much shorter periods given it already has an archival mechanism on L1. Of course, rollups will benefit directly from whatever scalability upgrades state management brings to L1 as well.

Statelessness + state expiry will directly multiply sharding execution, as each shard will also feature these scalability improvements. Though, given the scalability improvements statelessness + state expiry bring to the single execution chain, and the scalability rollups + data sharding offer, would we even need executable shards in the foreseeable future? Seems doubtful to me. I wasn't able to find any concrete information on how the current proposals will directly affect data shards, but I'd expect many of these concepts to be adapted for it in the future.

# Concluding

Proof-of-stake will solve sustainability. Rollups + data sharding will solve scalability. State size management was the last remaining challenge, and it's being met head on with some real, concrete proposals now. One could argue that privacy and VM innovations are a further pending challenge: but I'd expect rollups to better better address these. Indeed, we're seeing this with Aztec being privacy-focused, while zkSync 2.0 introduces LLVM and StarkWare has built a quantum-resistant StarkNet OS. Of course, learnings from these rollups can be adopted on L1 if desired.",1623918599,Liberosist,True,13,7,2021-06-17

ethereum,I have a simple question,"Ethereum -&gt; Ethereum 2.

We are all awaiting this with great anticipation. I hope it goes well, but a question in the back of my mind keeps bothering me.

Why should developers wait potentially years for Ethereum 2 to fully arrive, when more and more newer (and perhaps more technically capable) blockchains are either introducing or already have their own Ethereum Virtual Machines?

Developers can wait forever on Vitalik to fulfill his promises, or they can deploy their smart contract on a network that offers similar, same or even better (no transaction fees, high throughput etc) .... today. Even if the developers would rather stay on Ethereum, I imagine some Tech Lead or CEO type could easily force entire teams to make the switch. Shit, the developers might even end up liking whichever new blockchain they end up on and that'll be that.

ethereum,Added layer to mass adoption,"Just a thought. 

To aid in mass adoption of crypto in general, when doing odd jobs or anything where you‚Äôd ordinarily transact in cash under 100 dollars, let‚Äôs force whoever is paying to pay us in crypto, whichever it may be. 

Say a buddy asks for a ride and is willing to pay 10-20 dollars. Instead of accepting cash, agree to the deal only if they pay in crypto. 

If they don‚Äôt know how, kindly assist them with setting up an account and allowing you to watch every step of the way, as well as confirming the numbers with them before you send to your wallet from theirs. 

1. Don‚Äôt be a scumbag and send yourself 100 bucks in crypto while telling them it‚Äôs only 10 or 20 or whatever. 
2. Show them how the fees work as well. If you agreed to say 25 dollar payment, use enough out of the 25 to cover the gas fees for them the first time, while explaining how they work and letting them know they‚Äôll have to pay them per transaction. 


If you‚Äôre a kid in crypto, you‚Äôre probably more tech savvy than most adults. You can probably figure out how to download the necessary things to hold crypto. 

1. Pay each other in crypto for small amounts of cash. Say under 10 bucks if you‚Äôre a kid. Since you will need that cash in the short term just use small amounts. 
2. Tell your parents to give you gift money in the form of crypto. Forces them to use the technology and",1623871742,travelenergy,True,1,26,2021-06-17

Hi everyone, too much noise about NFT in the past months, so why not add some funny items to the mix. A group of friends and I are creating this new game concept, when you will have your CJ (Crypto Junkie avatar/character) and must consume drugs in forms of farmable tokens in order to not die and survive through the season. Becoming your CJ more valuable than the others that passed away (Deleted).

The reason that I writing this is because we need clever and active people, no matter your skills or experience; we need participative people, involved and commitment with the project.  

We don‚Äôt have plans to monetize as of yet, this is only for the experience and fun, this is an opportunity to become part of a team with other developers, financials and game-theorists people, to complete an heterogeneous group and putting your name in a big and remarkable game.

Some the drugs, seasons features, CJ interactions in-game and other mechanics stuff still need to be fine-tuned out in a test environment. 

Be part at this early stage, build an ambitious NFT game with Us and let fly high together, PM are available or just post your ideas below, ask anything I‚Äôm happy to answer you thanks!",1623865200,MorrisRedditStonk,True,0,0,2021-06-17

Edit: I understand that Metamask is an 'Ethereum explorer' so it would only NEED to be compatible with Ethereum blockchain, but I'm wondering what technology it is exactly that enables other wallets to be multi-blockchain-compatible.

Edit 2: Or am I visualising it all wrong (I came across the statement that wallets don't actually HODL any crypto -- they technically are just keys) and actually a wallet just acts a key that various different blockchains can accept?

Edit 3: It seems like e.g. Trust is actually an account that compiles a bunch of different wallet addresses and keys for different blockchains, so it's actually an aggregated wallet, not a single address that's compatible with a bunch of blockchains...

Obviously, I'm not sure this is a good idea, but still, having to do stuff on L1 is limiting. The problem I'm kind of sensing is that usually you ""move stuff"" from L1 to L2 and back. Here you'd have to say that ""whats real on L2 is real on L1"".

ethereum,A Business Idea: Trading Pools Automated with Smart Contracts,"Yo guys, I'm just a trader with a very low coding skills. If you think I don't know what I am talking about, please tell me so. Also, please show me similar successful websites (not shady bs $5 bots). I know this is not the first time someone thinks an idea like that, so please don't bash me :)

\--

I've been trading crypto for some time now. I was asked, like most of us, for help trading. I helped some people learn, I traded for friends and family, etc. I was thinking what if I offered this as a service.

The idea goes like this: I have a pool in a contract. People can connect their wallets, and their funds are locked for a period of time. In the meantime, I trade using Uniswap. I get some percentage out of their profits automatically, the rest is delivered to their wallets. They can get their all money after a lockup period or whenever they want.

It can also be like a market place. The beauty of this would be all trades are open. They can see past data, trades, and results. So, trading pool owner won't be able to fake results as everything is in the blockchain.

Something like this can bring successful traders and investors together, like hedge funds. Yet, the hedge funds only work with big clients and they are not available to public. Successful traders cannot trade with other people's money, because, regulations and shit. So, this should solve a lot of problems.

What do you guys think?

ethereum,Building an ecosystem of think-tank DAOs on Ethereum,"I've been wondering about the prospects, operationally and financially, of establishing a research unit as a DAO, one whose procurement of intellectual content may be monetizable via native currency, be it ETH or some more specialized one built upon Ethereum.

Are there any examples of think tanks, schools, or other research-based institutions launched as DAOs? Any legacy institutions that have launched some kind of auxiliary DAO?

Provided such an infrastructure is economically feasible, there could be good prospects for advancing the velocity of innovation across sectors, borders, and disciplines. As it is currently, there are mountains of open-source technical research, but I fear that the existing pathways of facilitating and delivering this research do not do it justice. I could be wrong, though.

Imagine the prospects of a constellation of decentralized research units, with considerably lower overhead than physically-embodied centers of research, each with as sharp a focus as it deems worthwhile. Researchers could be, in effect, traveling specialists without needing to leave their computer, so long as their academic acumen is translatable to blockchain-compatible terms. A sort of academic gig economy, but without the centralized likes of Uber, etc.

Intellectual property (PDFs?) as NFTs? Decentralized peer review (edit: peer-to-peer review)? Smart contracts that govern credentials instead of human academic incumbents? Niche micro-MOOCs?

In a way we already see the seeds of this with the ecosystem of independent scholars using podcasts at their platforms. Just seems like a system that could benefit, one way or the other, from blockchain technology.

Also, my first thought was Ethereum, but it could be an interchain ecosystem, as far as I can tell.",1623782637,Clinamenic,True,3,2,2021-06-16

Say Person A mints the NFT for Person B, is there a way for both of these people to gain royalties from future trades?

A few weeks later I talk to them again. Suddenly they're asking me questions about Dapps, DeFi and sharding(!). Turns out they found the [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org) website and read most of the learning pages. I was really impressed with their knowledge so I went to check it out afterwards.

The site has improved so much over time! The text seems very understandable for a general audience. All the nice artworks surely help too. I especially like [the page on the ETH2 vision](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/vision/).

Project A wants to raise $20,000,000 by selling their ERC-20 tokens. They want to list it on a DEX.

&amp;#x200B;

Do they need to provide $20,000,000 of ETH + $20,000,000 worth of their ERC-20 token, and then trade their ERC-20 tokens for ETH as the pool is filled with ETH and drained of their token?

ethereum,Trustless referral network based on ERC-20 token based dApp,"I am not entirely sure whether this is the correct forum to discuss a new idea based on an ERC-20 token. Also, I am not sure whether this use case is already considered and proven wrong. If so, letting me know will save a lot of valuable hours. 

My idea is to create a D-App, which is a trustless referral platform and curated marketplace to sell products from Amazon or any other marketplace which allows referral earnings. Anonymous users can connect their wallets to the platform and create collections based on their tastes. Whenever they create a collection, they will be awarded a certain amount for tokens. The token that users will get is a custom token that is generated specifically for this network. These users will be known as collectors.

Now normal users also can join the network and browse through collections. The collectors can either make their collections free or they can add a fee so that the normal users need to pay this fee in order to visit the collection. This way the token is being circulated. The referral links for each of the products will take the users to the corresponding market place and if they made a purchase, the commission will be processed. 75% of the commission will be awarded to users who make the purchase and 25% will go to the corresponding collector. This commission is also in terms of the token that is used in the network and based on the current dollar value of the token, 

I know this is very basic, but this is the idea. I am just testing whether this will work and it will be helpful if you let me know what you think about this? I am a programmer and web developer myself, so I can write smart contracts and deploy it to the network. If someone wanna join me, you are very much welcome.",1623738348,thatgloomyguy,True,2,4,2021-06-15

According to Metamask, the smart contract interaction was confirmed...but, because the transaction remains pending, the token exchange has yet to occur.

Between the time I initiated the transaction and the nonce made its way into the queue, the network became very congested. The gas fee I paid was about 1/3rd of what it would have been, should the transaction have been initiated a short time later.

This is what leads into my question - If a contract interaction is confirmed, but the transaction remains unsuccessful due to network congestion, could the nonce remain neglected indefinitely?

In other words - If it is impossible to pay the gas ""speed up"" fee, thus incentivising solving of the nonce, is the successful completion of the transaction (and the duration thereof) at risk of falling into oblivion?

At the very least, I assume transaction confirmation will (at the earliest) occur once the level of network traffic declines to where it was pre-initiation...but could it, theoretically, remain unconfirmed for ***days*** if sustained congestion levels declares it a low priority?",1623688393,VZ_Twosix,True,7,14,2021-06-15

ethereum,Trying to get funds to Matic without any Ethereum in my wallet,"I know this is a noob mistake, but it's an especially expensive one on Ethereum. I purchased some Matic on Binance and trying to transfer it to Matic network. I should've listened to the guy who suggested going through BSC but selling and rebuying Matic again seemed like more work initially (although in hindsight would have been probably easier). So I paid \~$20 to Binance to move my Matic to ERC20, figuring it would be a one-time fee that I would quickly recoup with some yield farming on Matic. I knew the bridge would cost me another $10 or so but didn't realize I could only pay that fee in Ethereum, which I don't have.

Now I'm in a position where I can't even buy Ethereum with my ERC20 Matic because swap fees are in Ethereum as well (I need \~$1.7 to approve Matic/Eth swap, and then I figure another couple bucks to trade it). Moving more money to Binance to buy some Ethereum to then send it to my wallet again would probably cost me another $50 in fees or so. What are my options to get the $5-10 in Eth I need without paying another $50 to get it to my wallet?

Someone contacted me for help. He has an ethereum wallet and he can't transfer them out of the wallet. As soon as he transfers ETH into his wallet, they are immediately send away.

How can he solve this?

I try to write a python script that sends the tokens to another address as soon as ETH appear. Its my first time interacting with web3 and python and I fail at specifying the ABI correctly to check how many tokens are on the wallet.

But I have in mind that the thief might check each block whether he sends ETH to this wallet and immediately creates an order to send them to the thief's wallet.

Vast regulations on exchanges and what they are allowed to own, trade and sell need to be put in place fast. One only needs to look at Bitcoin to see it is at the point of being traded with bots to create volume to pamp up the price with little purchases after every sell. Then I found this article below and tether was just kicked out of NY. These fraudsters seem like they are ruining crypto. If this is true can the projects do anything about phony coins on their blockchain from purchasing the blockchain? Think about it, tether is printed on Ethereum and then used to buy Ethereum but there is not a dollar behind the stable coin. In fact they printed so much tether after the Bitcoin crash to buy Bitcoin it was bizarre. Tethers are never burned like other stable coins it seems, they just keep printing more never needing to burn them? They basically stole Ethers with counterfeit dollars printed on its own network using a central bank and exchanges. They can sell them at any price now they need to to keep bringing in cash to pay people off.

ethereum,Building a literally indestructible censorship-resistant marketing tool with Ethereum technology - the idea of a madman - the APEX of Ethereum smart contracts,"""The only way to immortalize a free society is free software"" - words of the creator.

So it's understandable that the title sounds like an exaggeration or a ""bait"" to get your attention but, in this case.  It's actually the real deal. So hear me out.

So to give some background here and get straight to the point without wasting your time.

SamPorter is a russian-crazy former hacker who is obsessed with a free society and multi polar capitalism. In his own words ""a schizo""

What this ""schizo"" has to do with ethereum?

**Introduction to ""aletheo""**

\- Aletheo is a project that's completely based on the concept of freedom and expansion of both anti censorship and multi polar capitalism.

The two whitepapers available to get a better understanding so far are the following:

(they are huge you can read them after the post)

[https://github.com/SamPorter1984/Aletheo/blob/main/papers/Aletheo%20Whitepaper%200.5.pdf](https://github.com/SamPorter1984/Aletheo/blob/main/papers/Aletheo%20Whitepaper%200.5.pdf)

[https://github.com/SamPorter1984/Aletheo/blob/7378cbb393f4c09e0c5f92b22dae9842d9807ac9/papers/RAID%20whitepaper%20v0.2.pdf](https://github.com/SamPorter1984/Aletheo/blob/7378cbb393f4c09e0c5f92b22dae9842d9807ac9/papers/RAID%20whitepaper%20v0.2.pdf)

A better summary because these are unfiltered wishes-thoughts-obsessions of a talented but eccentric person:

""Aletheo will be nomadic, truly decentralized software, completely unstoppable and censor-free, indestructible in theory, with infinite potential to make passive income for everyone"".

In his own words in fact, if this becomes big enough it **can even solve global poverty**.

In simpler terms the project requires 2 things:

Founders: People who will influence the world and they will have more than just money, but power. But that power and money won't have the capability to interrupt, control, or centralize anything, they will just benefit, get benefitted, provide, and get provided. 

Users will be able to work unconditionally, and get paid unconditionally, with no medium, no middleman, from home. And all that just by using.

&amp;#x200B;

And about **ETHEREUM**

Ethereum was created for aletheo, a censorship resistant blockchain with programmable transactions, aletheo is the apex of power as of now today translated into code. Aletheo can make ethereum unbannable, immortal, and indestructible.

&amp;#x200B;

The library he used and the beginning of everything was:

Join the founding event: [https://aletheo.net/](https://aletheo.net/)

The success of this project is inevitable, because of constant shilling. even if founding event literally gains only 40 ether, it's still enough for a big start.

Supporting such a big - and weird project in its early stages is madness but, technologically wise it's bound to succeed.

ethereum,EIL5: How Are Dapps Any More De-Centralized Than The Platforms We Currently Use?," I was browsing r/ethereum this morning, and I saw a cool post where a student in Australia was able to pull up his/her test scores on a blockchain powered by Ethereum. This is really, really cool -- I thought: ‚ÄúWow! This is only the beginning for real world Ethereum use cases.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm having some trouble understanding how this example concretely looks like, which is why I wanted to solicit help from this community, to hopefully understand the concept of Ethereum a little bit better :) 

Forgive me if I butcher this explanation; I‚Äôm new to this whole blockchain stuff and I‚Äôm outlining this in the best way that I can best understand it:

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, so in the Australian test score example, I‚Äôd imagine there is some sort of decentralized application (dApp) the Australian school system (A.S.S. for short) uses to post student test scores. To keep random hackers (or trolls) from posting false test scores on this blockchain and trolling up the entire grade posting, I‚Äôd imagine the A.S.S. needs some sort of gate-keeping code to say: ‚Äúonly those who verifiably work in the A.S.S. can publicly post blockchains on this dApp‚Äù. This, most likely, requires some sort of login/password system; only those with A.S.S. -verified accounts can make postings/edits. 

Though, this got me thinking: yes, we are keeping student grade data on a decentralized blockchain, but at the end of the day, access is still centralized under the dApp. I understand the security of keeping something on the Ethereum Blockchain itself, but couldn‚Äôt a hacker instead steal the A.S.S. login credentials on the dApp, and make all sorts of fake grade postings? 

I understand that it is more secure to keep (student) data on a blockchain, because once posted on the blockchain, it can never get erased/wiped off the blockchain. However, when it comes to security of ‚ÄúWho is making new posts on the blockchain‚Äù, I‚Äôm having trouble understanding how centralizing access on a dApp is any more secure than centralizing (student) data across a school-shared (Microsoft?) drive.

Injector: Metamask 9.5.9

Laptop: Asus G14 Ryzen 9 4900HS w/ 16GB RAM

OS: Windows 10 64-Bit

Hey folks.  I can not seem to find any information on this issue for the life of me.  I run a lot of open tabs with a myriad of DeFi dapps across multiple blockchains.  I'm using Metamask as the web3 injector and everything seems to run swimmingly at first, but the longer I get into sessions, the more I notice my laptop getting warm to hot.  Task manager occasionally shows Firefox child processors maxing out single-cores, and force quitting those will crash the respective tab(s), cool down the laptop, and restore performance, but it won't often be long before I notice that I'm back to having hot thighs.

I've added Auto Tab Discard to try and unload tabs I'm not using, but it seems that if I'm working in any dapps, even if the others are discarded/asleep, it'll start warming up again.  I can't find out if its Firefox, Metamask, or some other issue, let alone how to resolve it.  I was thinking of trying Brave browser, but I wanted to see if this was a familiar issue to anyone before migrating everything over to a new browser where the same issues might exist.

ethereum,"Elon Musk, Markets and Money üí∞","**Elon Musk, Market and Money**

 

Elon Musk has always evoked public interest (as billionaire genius types tend to do). The ongoing story this year, for better or worse, has been in the crypto space, where people have [taken](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1284291528328790016) their cues from his [views.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203?lang=en)

Earlier this year Tesla caused waves when they published their [balance sheet](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm) and announced to the world that they had 1.5 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC) listed as an asset. More recently, Musk's comments have prompted crypto sales that have seen the price of Bitcoin tumble from above $60,000 into the $30,000-$40,000 range. Overall, the collective crypto market cap fell by just over a trillion dollars over May.

# Musk and Market

&gt;So why does Elon seem to have this power to influence the world of crypto?

First, let's talk about **money** in **all its forms: fiat and crypto**. Arguably, **money is a type of social power storage, like a battery**. We use it to temporarily **store our power to engage others** (on our projects and for our whims), and when we pay for a good or a service, we draw on that power. In a similar vein to electricity, it is a consumable resource and is transferred as it is used.

After that, the question is which money (or battery) to use? History shows that an implicit contract exists between society and the choice of money system: At various points in world history, including Weimar, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, nation state-backed fiat systems have broken down because economic agents broke this contract.

Elon Musk, in this context, has a good amount of stored social power (money). This social power he harnesses can move markets, as we see below.

# Market and Money

This points to **monetary systems as a type of database that accounts for social power**, but only if **we agree to use that database**. In this vein, a token system is a medium for value storage (and possibly utility storage) for a network of users that choose to adopt that system using a social contract. If the database is corrupt, why would you use it?

Less dramatic than the collapse of a national currency is the assignment of social power to crypto assets. Over a decade, a social contract has developed between crypto and a user network, along with bridges between crypto tokens and fiat tokens as valid stores of value. Remember the guy who paid 10,000BTC for two pizzas in 2010? That was the start of a social contract that turned BTC into a form of social power storage.

The beauty of crypto is that we are now moving from a type of general-purpose money backed by states to a system of fit-for-purpose tokens that do weird and wonderful things. However, the network effects on cryptocurrencies are more pronounced and subject to social whimsy.

# Musk and Money

Elon‚Äôs whims can either **endorse the implicit contract** between BTC and other forms of **storing social power** (Dogecoin) or they can repudiate this contract. Earlier this year, the decision to add BTC to the balance sheets of Tesla acted as an **endorsement of value**. And so, on cue, people bought more BTC.

Now Elon is tweeting the other way, and Tesla has decided not to accept BTC as a form of payment for its vehicles. The good news is that while toddlers stumble more than adults, eventually, we all learn to walk.

# Bitcoin, the new money

The difference between crypto and fiat is simple. We are privatising money. Thus, the risk to governments everywhere is that society decouples (at least partially) from the default, nation-state fiat store of value because there are valid alternatives. Is it good or bad? You decide.",1623455859,PeacockMamba,True,1,7,2021-06-12

ethereum,The biggest hindrance to making crypto mainstream (My opinion obviously),"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am just putting this on this forum to get some response from you all and see if my opinion is shared or if I am just an idiot. Also, it makes me think of a potential business idea so I wanted to see what you all thought.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with crypto right now and making it normalized is that it is complex.  Yes, I understand that it is a total different system than what we currently run on, so you are going to need to learn it to be able to use it.  I get that, but the issue is that a lot of people do not want to spend the time to learn a new system, but may want to be able to use it.

""Well don't be lazy and learn how it works, how to use a wallet, how to fund the wallet etc"". This is true, but people are fucking lazy, that's why people don't switch between different banks, simply because they are too lazy to do so even if they are unhappy with their current bank (this is coming from someone who worked for Wells Fargo for 3 years - shitty bank, but people stay because they just don't want to spend the time to help themselves).

&amp;#x200B;

this made me think ""how can you get someone to get into Crypto without having the learning curve issues with it?"" I don't think I have the perfect answer, but I think that a company that actually does the setup for the customer and also keeps their codes/seed phrases secure would help a lot more people come on board.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know that this somewhat flies in the face of what many would say is the point of crypto currency ""not your key, not your wallet"" I think is the term people use, but think about trying to get your mom or dad into this (assuming we are mostly millennials/Gen z's) - first you need to walk them through what wallet they should get and honestly even as a millennial the amount of wallets and trying to figure out which one is right for you can be a little exhausting, with how new the tech is, it is sometimes hard to figure out which wallets are legit, not to mention which ones are the best.

&amp;#x200B;

Once you have the wallet issue figured out, you need to figure out how to work DeFi/whatever Dapps you are using - while this might be simple for most people here, funding your wallet and then staking/using defi can be confusing for many, also remember that most board members of companies are going to be older than most of us here, so trying to get companies to use DeFi would take convincing of management at companies that it is safe, and people usually don't think something is safe if they cannot use it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm somewhat rambling now, but I think a company that could help with this for institutions/individuals would actually help crypto out a lot as I think this is a major issue of crypto, but I wanted to see if you all thought that this is incorrect or if I'm missing anything.

ethereum,"Online Pseudonym Parties fully implemented half a year ago, and game theory around ""proof-of-unique-human""","In my own opinion, Ethereum project collapsed a bit when the majority of the validators chose to break the hash chain continuity in 2016, and chose to create something like a (very complicated) second genesis block on block number 1920000. And that since then, it's been whoever shouts the loudest that gets attention. This is fine, I chose to prioritize other things instead.

I finished my proof-of-unique-human system half a year ago, full implementation: [https://snippet.host/tqcr](https://snippet.host/tqcr). For anyone interested in working on that, there you have the source code.

A lot of people seem to believe a web-of-trust is a good basis for majority vote-type systems. It really isn't. Webs-of-trust are great for other things, but, for ""centralized"" proof-of-unique-human"" it is probably dead in the water. See ""[proofofhumanity.id](https://proofofhumanity.id)"" or ""BrightID"", and probably a few others. I chose the opposite approach, basically to start from the *exact opposite* of a web-of-trust.

On that last note, what Satoshi (Craig Wright) has said over and over, is that so many people \*wanted\* his invention to be a ""web of trust"". Because people *like* webs-of-trust, you are in control in those. But you can't use them for everything. And you cannot use them for majority vote, was my conclusion.

Just a heads up, if anyone is interested in the proof-of-unique-human problem, game theoretically.",1623335055,johanngr,True,2,15,2021-06-10

ethereum,Why do some projects like to have their liquidity staked?,"Help me understand this.

I provide liquidity for project X with an ETH pairing at 50:50 X/ETH on Uniswap. In return I receive LP-Tokens for 50:50 X/ETH that represent the value of my liquidity + fees earned. I will need these LP-Tokens to pull out my liquidity + fees earned at any given time and move on.

Now, project X has a partner program called project XY ( they work together within the same ecosystem). Project XY offers me to earn XY Tokens if I were to ""stake"" my LP-Tokens from project X with them.

***Here are my questions:***

How and Why does Staking work with LP-Tokens? ( in nuanced detail would be great )

Why would Project XY like to have Project X's LP-Tokens staked with them? ( other than obvious things such as stability of liquidity, please mention every detail if you know the answer to this )

Are there different kinds of Staking in regard to ERC20 tokens and if so, how does one research relevant differences and what are they?

As I'm still learning, I might not be able to ask all the important questions in this regard., so if I have left an obvious relevant question to this topic out, feel free to put it in the room and answer it too if you know how.

ethereum,Local fullnode is one block behind,"I just created a local Binance Smart Chain fullnode on my PC with the following specs:  

OS: Linux running on Windows Subsystem for Linux  

Storage: 1TB SSD (Samsung 980 Pro)  

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800x  

Ram: 32GB  

Internet speed: 940 mbps up/down fiber  

I set up the fullnode late last night and was surprised to see that it was synced within about 14 hours. I verified that it was synced by using \`eth.syncing\` in the \`geth\` console, checked the output of my logs, and verified that I was pulling the most recent block by using \`web3.eth.get\_block('latest')\` from the Python \`Web3.py\` library while connected to localhost. However, I was doing some testing and noticed that sometimes \`web3.eth.get\_block('latest')\` from [https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/](https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/) was pulling later blocks than my local fullnode.  

For example, these commands were run in succession:

    # connected to https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
    In: web3_bsc.eth.get_block('latest')['number']
    Out: 8079724
    # connected to local fullnode
    In: web3_local.eth.get_block('latest')['number']
    Out: 8079723
    # connected to https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
    In: web3_bsc.eth.get_block('latest')['number']
    Out: 8079724

How is my local fullnode behind [https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/](https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/)?

One of the biggest factors preventing crypto from widespread adaptation is volatility. Plenty of stablecoins have tried to solve this, but they‚Äôve all had some sort of issue. They‚Äôre either centralized, can‚Äôt hold a peg, insanely vulnerable to external financial shock, or some combination. I have what I think is a new idea for a stablecoin, and I‚Äôd like some feedback.

The basic concept of relatively simple: instead of using oracles or collateral to maintain a peg, we fix the cost of creating a new coin to $1.

The coin would be mineable. According to Moore‚Äôs law, computing power increases at a relatively stable rate, so the mining difficulty could be adjusted daily by a contract to ensure that the price of mining a new coin is always $1.

I‚Äôm not entirely sure if this makes sense, and it‚Äôs definitely a very early idea that certainly has numerous issues. I‚Äôd appreciate any feedback I can get.",1623264849,PotatoHeadz35,True,1,5,2021-06-10

Matic is straight up Geth with a different chain Id. Their bridging argument simply doesn't make sense. Also one criticism of Ethereum community praising Vitalik donating to India Covid is that Vitalik didn't donate fiat he donated Eth and we don't need to criticize Indian governments stance on crypto. Blockchain has uses but the community goes about like they are shilling their favorite project. The community praises Musk when he says good about Ethereum and then denigrates him when he says bad. The reason crypto prices fluctuates is cause you guys get influenced. Rug pullers are not to blame for this. They are just doing whats in the best interest for them. You need to do whats in the best interest for you. **Finance is not a meme.** **Summary of my rant is Be pragmatic and find real use instead of creating hype or getting influenced by someone hyping you.

Meanwhile I've since stumbled upon projects like Radix which is a DLT claiming they've ""solved"" the trilemma at scale. Fully sharded L1 protocol would mean composability at scale, which I think is ethereum's biggest weakness.

There is unbelievably strong network effects on ethereum, but if people keep using sidechains, rollups, etc then it becomes less about eth and more about the individual apps and what they can accomplish with these other techs.

My understanding is that right now, anyone can randomly enter a bunch of the the 24 word recovery phrase combinations to try and hack into an ETH wallet (and yes, I understand how unlikely it is you will hit one but thats not my point).

Wouldn‚Äôt it be much more secure to require the public key first, and then enter the private key/24 word phrase to unlock it? That would be exponentially harder, no?

This is what I‚Äôve never understood about ETH keys. I get that its essentially impossible to guess a private key.. but why not take it a step further by requiring the equivalent of a specific username first (in the ETH use case this would be the public key) and then the password/recovery code (the private key in the ETH use case)?

I chose ETH in particular due to sheer numbers and the fact that it is way more efficient than Bitcoin. To put it terms most will understand... BTC is Blackberry at its height and ETH is Apple slowly getting ready to dominate market share. I am not a multi-millionaire by any means but this investment for me is long term (3-7 years) and I am prepared to lost it if I am wrong about ETH. It will hurt, but no on got set for life by playing it safe. With all that said... I am on the train that will hopefully get upgraded to a rocket ...

However, I feel that in some ways blockchains, at least general purpose ones, are well suited for regulation.  If you know the input(s) into a smart contract, you for sure know its output.  And smart contracts are open source and readable.  As such, authorities could ""limit"" (not sure how) transactions to certified or audited smart contracts.  They cannot control or prevent a transaction, nor do they even need to know the specifics of the transaction, they just need to know it happened through a smart contract that isn't contributing to illegal activity.

ethereum,Just buy and hold ETH vs. using Aave vs. Uniswap vs. Alchemix,"Am I the only one who doesn't get the appeal of all of these financial crypto stuff? 

I really don't understand why anyone wouldn't just keep investing in ETH and hold, vs. transferring ETH and converting them to tokens on Alchemix or Uniswap or Aave and start doing staking/pooling to earn a relatively tiny amount of interest rate in exchange face a lot more risks of losing their ETH. 

In the case of Uniswap - if you are pooling you are trading 50% of ETH toward another coin that in the long-run is not going to be as valuable as ETH, so you are losing money due to price divergence in exchange for getting fees, but those fees are gonna be small in the long run compared to just holding 100% of ETH and see it appreciate. 

In the case of Aave, you are giving up ETH in exchange for Aave's aToken, while theoretically this aToken gives you interest rate, the value of aToken could grow slower than ETH in the long-run or have something else happen to it (point is, it is NOT ETH), which still means you are losing out when compared to just straight up holding ETH. Plus, interest rate is pretty low nowadays for depositing ETH on aave anyways, trying any other crypto is too risky, and there are still unknown risks and costs of just moving money around on Aave. 

In the case of Alchemix - again, it's great that you get some upfront money, but then you have to pay it back over time plus pay interests. And you are asked to pay more than you get in the beginning so in the long run, you still lose money. Alchemix is basically a loan shark. People love getting money upfront, but at what cost?  

I'm not looking to make $100. I am looking to 10x my investment. And I think the best way to do this is to just buy ETH and HOLD. All of these fancy financial instruments are full of traps, and act more like a bank for the poor or a casino or lottery machine for those who are addicted to gambling. In the end, the house always wins. 

I think maybe if you work at a $B hedge fund trading crypto, you can build an algorithm to take advantage of loop holes, but ordinary people should just stick with buy and hold.",1623189958,fatfirewoman,True,1,3,2021-06-09

ethereum,[EthMag] Proposed scheme for encoding Ethereum state into a Verkle tree,"Link: [https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-verkle-tree-scheme-for-ethereum-state/5805](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-verkle-tree-scheme-for-ethereum-state/5805)

One of the things that I want to do at the same time as moving the current Ethereum state to a [Verkle tree](https://notes.ethereum.org/_N1mutVERDKtqGIEYc-Flw) to cut witness sizes is to move it from the current 2-layer ""trie inside a trie"" structure to a single-layer structure.

You may have seen diagrams of the Ethereum state like this before:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/paa4fwmlk3471.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2bd8d1c96c15f24bfca6fbef65ab11b4134f469

The state consists of a set of accounts, where each account contains a header. Each header in turn contains a pointer to a piece of code, and a root of another whole *account-specific* tree. This structure has a few really annoying problems:

1. It's complicated. There's a lot of extra code that needs to be written to handle the tree-inside-a-tree mechanism, as well as the special cases for accessing things in the account header that are not storage (ie. nonce/balance/code). This complexity appears in many places: database reads/writes, Merkle proof construction, Merkle proof verification, syncing, caching...
2. It's unbalanced: there are individual subtrees that have a huge amount of data in them. This is annoying for state sync protocols, because you can't make any assumption that what looks like a ""small portion"" of the state (eg. all objects starting with 0x7A5) will actually be small
3. It doubles worst-case tree attack lengths
4. It becomes even more complicated to figure out the interplay between state and mechanisms such as [state expiry](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/state_expiry_paths). Anything that manipulates the state piece-by-piece would need separate logic for account-level and storage-slot-level manipulations

I propose an alternative, which fits the entire Ethereum state into a single key:value trie. That is, every position in the state (eg. `(address, storage_slot)`, `(address, NONCE)`, `(address, code_chunk_index)`) gets mapped to a single 32-byte `key`, which is where it is stored in the trie. As a witness-size-optimization feature, the trie is designed in such a way that the last byte of the key is always a separate commitment (Verkle trees are made up of commitments, where each commitment can have many children, in our case up to 256). Here's an example of how this might look:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0uqek39cp3471.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5978af80832b143d0d5caf7085a92c37612a645c

There is no ""trie of tries"" design, and there is also no special serialization for a header; instead, header and code are both mapped to keys, just like storage. Values which share the first 31 bytes of their key are put into the same bottom-layer commitment; this saves witness space for common use cases (verifying many header fields or code chunks or adjacent storage slots). Note that accounts will no longer be ""under one subtree"" the way they are today; different parts of the storage of an account will be in different locations in the state trie.

For the sake of illustration, here's part of the code in my proposal, which shows how values inside addresses will get mapped to trie keys:

`def get_tree_key(address: Address, tree_index: int, sub_index: int):`

`return (`

`hash(address + tree_index.to_bytes(32, 'big'))[:31] +`

`bytes([sub_index])`

`)`

`def get_tree_key_for_balance(address: Address):`

`return get_tree_key(address, 0, 1)`

`def get_tree_key_for_nonce(address: Address):`

`return get_tree_key(address, 0, 2)`

`def get_storage_slot_tree_key(address: Address, storage_key: int):`

`if storage_key &lt; 64:`

`return get_tree_key(address, 0, 64 + storage_key)`

`else:`

`return get_tree_key(address, 2**248 + storage_key // 256, storage_key % 256)` 

Notice in particular how values in the header get mapped to trie keys that share the first 31 bytes, so they are part of the same bottom-level commitment, and adjacent storage slots (and code too) benefit from the same treatment. 

Additionally, storage slots 0...63 have the privilege of being part of the same bottom-level commitment as the header, so witness size for accessing these frequently used slots is *really* low. Gas costs (see next section) will be adjusted to take advantage of this; the current proposal charges a flat 200 gas per slot for these first 64 slots.

# Witness gas cost reform

An important reform that needs to happen alongside this is gas cost reform, finishing the work that was started in EIP 2929 by making gas costs closely map to witness data usage in all cases. This allows us to ensure tight witness size bounds for Ethereum blocks (even including worst-case attacks on the trie that require 2\*\*80 computing power, we're looking at \~6 MB witnesses; under more ""normal"" circumstances witness size will be &lt;2 MB).

A necessary part of this is introducing gas costs for accessing code chunks (see [this proto-EIP](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/witness_gas_cost_2); the current plan is \~200 gas per 31-byte chunk). That proto-EIP goes further, however, and harmonizes gas costs more generally so that they align with this trie structure: 1900 gas for a new branch proof, and 200 gas for a new value in the same bottom-level commitment.

Some preliminary analysis of code chunk gas costs have shown that this may increase contract calling cost by \~10%. However, this new gas scheme will also introduce some important benefits for developers. A notable benefit is that gas costs for accessing many adjacent storage slots (eg. single persistent variables in Solidity are typically mapped to storage slots 0, 1, 2....n) will drop from \~2100 per storage slot to \~200 per storage slot after the first. Hence, well-designed contracts could easily get savings that make up for the increased cost of code access. Additionally, the per-chunk and per-subtree costs mean that contracts that call to libraries will no longer be much less efficient than large contracts that keep all their code together in one piece.",1623185183,vbuterin,True,1,16,2021-06-09

ethereum,Interacting with Wrapped ETH contract on Ropsten vs Mainnet,"Hi,

I'm in the process of trying to teach myself a bit more about Smart Contracts and figured a good place to start would be learning how to manually make trades through using the ""Write Contract"" swapExactETHForTokens function, bypassing various DEX GUIs.

I am playing on Ropsten (because who wants to make an expensive mistake?) and I'm currently just simulating a WETH &gt; Uni trade through the Uniswap router.

I am able to get it to work using these settings:

Contract: 0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d    (Uniswap V2 Router)  
Path: 0xc778417e063141139fce010982780140aa0cd5ab,0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984

What I don't understand is why it fails using 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2 for Wrapped ETH, which appears to be what the transactions on the Mainnet use when I trace things through dextools. That CA appears to exist on Ropsten, but when I use it the transaction fails due to a path error, and I have to use 0xc778417e063141139fce010982780140aa0cd5ab for WETH instead.

I'd rather avoid making costly gas errors when I start to try doing actual on mainnet, so I was hoping to understand this discrepancy before going any further.

If anyone can educate me on what's going on here, I'd appreciate it. I was expecting everything to be a mirror between main and test, at least as far as CAs were concerned.",1623165013,Eredyn,True,1,4,2021-06-08

ethereum,What exactly is the gas limit per Block?,"I just read about EIP 1559 and im wondering what exactly the gas limit per block means.

Why do we have a limit of 12,5m per Block on the Ethereum Blockchain?

Is the raise to max 25m per Block just for the equilibrium mechanics so they can adjust the base fee?

Means 25m Gas, that if im willing to pay (basefee+tip=25m gwei) i get my very own block for my transaction?

I think im missing something, because i dont really get what gas is and how much is used per transaction etc.

If its that easy to raise gaslimit and get more tps, why dont we have 100m blocks?

Why, if the max gas limit is really high it can happen you mine an empty block? what is an empty block?

In my opinion this is a dangerous practice, and can easily precipitate civil unrest.

I think an exciting application of blockchain is in decentralised voting. By this method voter fraud would become basically impossible? Every citizen would be provided with a unique voter account upon reaching legal voting age and then could submit their vote incentivised by some sort of token?

ethereum,Portfolio Just bought 11K of Ethereum in its first week. A crypto that invest," **What is Portfolio Token?**  
\-PORTFOLIO is a token on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It‚Äôs the first of its kind utility token that invest into promising assets such as real estate, promising crypto coins, stock and others to back its value, stability, and overall worth, all while increasing it‚Äôs holders‚Äô profits.

How does this make Portfolio different?

All crypto is still crypto but when you break into something that actually exists that's when it becomes interesting and a long term play. What would actually happen if some tokens just disappear? Nothing non virtual people would lose money and some websites would go down but business will go on as usual. When you have something tangible it can't just disappear.  
Portfolio will be a tangible token even when crypto crashes.

**How does the investor benefit?**  
The investor will get 3X reflections when holding the coin.  
\- Every time someone buys/sells of PTF token.  
\- Every time someone An asset gets bought  
\- Every time the profit goes into the Liquidity Pool

While inflating the LP we create a more stable market for the Token to grow in.  
Once we hit the exchange all the profit of the assets will get distributed among the holders according to their holding share benefitting all those who have been holding.

**How does PORTFOLIO invest?**  
\- PORTFOLIO has a 10% transaction fee for every trade. 5% is awarded to each holder automatically  
while the other 5% is put into a separate investment wallet. This wallet is publicly displayed on our  
assets page of the website. Every week 60% of the investment wallet will be converted to BNB to  
invest into assets. This transaction will generate another 5% payout to the holders. Of the leftover  
40% we will then burn 5% of the token and the remaining 35% will be paired with profits from our  
investments and put into the liquidity pool.

**How often do investments and payouts occur?**  
\-Investments will take place weekly. Profits gained from investments will be distributed bi-weekly.

**Can the community invest in upcoming investments?**  
\-Absolutely, we encourage the community to  
engage in the voting for investments. More announcements to come.

**In the event of a loss or no profit of an investment, what would happen?**  
\-The best part about this token is that the holders assume no risk but only stand to gain when an  
investment gains a profit. For example: If Portfolio purchases 1 Bitcoin at 40K and it increases to 60K,  
we will be able to pay out 20K to holders. If we purchased bitcoin at 40K and then it dropped to 30K,  
we would just hold the asset with no loss to the holders. Once the asset surpasses its purchase price,  
all profits will then be paid out.

**What platforms can PORTFOLIO be purchased on?**  
\-As of now, Pancakeswap is the only exchange that the token is available on.

Devs are doxxed, full names + Linkedin will be posted on the website once it's updated.

ethereum,Staking farm?,"Hi, I've been reading about the planned transition of Ethereum from mining to staking. I know for staking uptime is essential, and SSD space probably also matters. But I wanted to ask what components are necessary to stake at a largeish scale? If a computer with a single GPU is a basic mining rig, and a massive multi-GPU setup is a farm, what's the equivalent of that for Eth 2.0? A threadripper with a ton of SSDs attached?",1623100895,Captain_Starkiller,True,2,11,2021-06-08
ethereum,The Limits to Blockchain Scalability on vitalik.ca,"At the end of the article Vitalik writes this: 

&gt; Quantifying this risk is easy. Take the blockchain's data capacity in MB/sec, and multiply by ~30 to get the amount of data stored in terabytes per year. The current sharding plan has a data capacity of ~1.3 MB/sec, so about 40 TB/year. If that is increased by 10x, this becomes 400 TB/year. If we want the data to be not just accessible, but accessible conveniently, we would also need metadata (eg. decompressing rollup transactions), so make that 4 petabytes per year, or 40 petabytes after a decade. The Internet Archive uses 50 petabytes. So that's a reasonable upper bound for how large a sharded blockchain can safely get.

&gt; Hence, it looks like on both of these dimensions, the Ethereum sharding design is actually already roughly targeted fairly close to reasonable maximum safe values. The constants can be increased a little bit, but not too much.

I don't really understand how this is going to work. If the blockchain gets this big then only archive.org or other providers will be able to run full nodes. I'm sure there's something I'm missing but I'm not sure what it is. Is it actually planned that in the future of Ethereum you'll need petabyte storage to run a full node?",1623100850,aemmeroli,True,3,9,2021-06-08

This is where we get the EIP authors and editors to talk us through upcoming changes in their own words.

Last week Danny and Vitalik took us through [Altair upgrade changes...](https://youtu.be/iaAEGs1DMgQ) **Next week's Peep an EIP will feature:**

* [EIP-3541](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3541): Reject new contracts starting with the 0xEF byte (this is included in the London upgrade in July, along with 1559)
* [EIP-3540](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3540): EVM Object Format (EOF) v1 (being considered for the Shanghai upgrade, which will be before or after The Merge TBC)

The EIP authors - Alex Beregszaszi, Pawe≈Ç Bylica, and Andrei Maiboroda - will be covering these and taking questions.

**If you have any questions on EIPs 3540 and 3541, post as a comment here** by 18:30 UTC on Wednesday and we'll do our best to put them to the authors on the call.",1623097253,Coldsnap,True,1,0,2021-06-08

Does this reduce MEV per time? (say 2 quicker &amp; smaller vs 1 regular block)


The thought I had:

As a simplification let's assume there are n transactions in a small &amp; quick block and the miner can decide their order (this absolutely simplifies how the mempool and MEV works, maybe this is a critical flaw in my thought?). 
There are n! possible permutations for how transactions can be ordered combinatorically. In two of the small &amp; quick blocks, miners hence have 2*(n!) of options. The regular block holds 2n transactions which allow (2*n)! permutations.

As 2*(n!) &lt; (2*n)!, n&gt;1, the optionality is superadditive, ie bigger, when combining the two smaller &amp; quicker blocks. If MEV is a function of optionality, the smaller blocks would reduce MEV per time.

ethereum,.Crypto Domain names and the ETH?,"I am no financial advisor and this is not financial advise just a opinion:

Reason why I am posting this is because not many are talking about it on the sub.

Since this web 3.0 is the latest and greatest development which is going to happen,

And the .crypto domain names (which are NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain) have the potential to be huge.

While I am still skeptical if it will really take of, both in terms of usage and price, still I am buying mine since most are just $40 and transferring it to wallet is cheaper as the ETH is down right.

However, could this trend really take off?

Honestly I don't know, 

*Here are some points against it:*

* People are more familiar with the .com or .net more than the .crypto
* Development of the actual website on it is hard 
* Viewing the .crypto website same requires additional steps in browser

*Here are some points in favor:*

* **They are forever** (or at least till Ethereum exists) - this is probably the biggest USP. If blockchain based website take off in web 3.0 than no one will want to pay annual fees for having a domain.
* They are an Ethereum NFT - which means they can be easily transferred between between wallets easily.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly no one can predict what will work or not work in the future, but after missing out on a lot of Crypto I willing to part with a few buck just to try. Now all is left is look for a cool name.

ethereum,Trying to understand Smart Contract Fees,"Hello everyone, I'm starting to use some DeFi applications more and more recently and it's being a great experience so far.

As a part of DeFi applications, you have to pay fees to use them all the time, and some of them I just don't understand. I will list my questions below with some examples

Yesterday I used [ALCX](https://app.alchemix.fi/) for some staking. At first, I had to ""approve ALCX spend limit"" on MetaMask and this transaction only costs me 
0.00065315600004 Ether ($1.72) as shown [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7f0e359709ce7352df6e63d21a6a25c93ca759a316e37f909d067cb66d9f3bd3). My question is, what is Spend Limit Approval, and why fees for it are so low in comparison with other Ethereum uses cases? Second, I could only actually use the staking protocol after this approval shown above, why is that? 

So I paid this fee and actually got able to use the staking protocol, when the fees were considerably [higher](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa86b72ffff9e8a192dcf759978d0405cde0fbe4a7f7bc5cff87174513df33665). Why the fees for Smart Contracts are higher than a normal transaction? (this can also be seen on the [EtherScan](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) gas dashboard, where it shows that fees are higher for Uniswap Swap and Uniswap Add/Remove LP.)",1622901627,RedManBrasil,True,1,5,2021-06-05

ethereum,Ethereum and Cardano are both a few years old. Eth has many projects building on its platform while Cardano barely has any. Why is that?,"Same for Polkadot, and it's only a year old. Cardano does not seem to attract developers and projects. Why do you think this is?

I've heard:
1) The Haskell programming language is difficult to master or just very different than traditional programming languages.
2) Eth and Dot gave a lot of funds away to projects building on their platforms, while Cardano focused on development and peer reviewed research implementation instead.
3) Cardano does not have smart contracts yet while Eth and Dot (sort of) do. Cardano is incomplete to the point it's not worth it to build on it yet. 
4) Cardano doesn't sufficiently add any improvements over Eth or other smart contract coins.

But when I go into the Trezor to send it, the app tells me the fee is $6.36 on the normal setting. If I change to CUSTOM, this is where I get confused.

It won't let me change the GAS LIMIT down to 61,000 which I read is the lowest for ERC20. It requires it at 200,000.   To get under $3, I have to set the gas price to 5 GWEI but that is much lower than the current fees.

What is going on? Why are my fees still so much higher than the current fees?

If you simply leave BETH on your spot wallet, you receive daily distributions associated with the staked ETH in the Beacon chain.

For lack of a better term, I will refer to these as ""regular BETH rewards"" (please correct me if I'm wrong).

Now, I do have some doubts and I was hoping you guys could help me (sorry I couldn't find the answer on binance):

(1) Do you get ETH2.0 rewards if you withdraw your BETH, say, to a hardware wallet? In other words, do rewards associated with your BETH ""follow"" you, or do you have to keep it in binance?

(2) The article I linked to above mentions other ""ways to use BETH"", like providing liquidity for example. But again, I don't understand, is any yield you might generate _in addition to_ the daily ETH 2.0 distributions?

I first heard about zkSNARKs with zCash as a privacy tool. A few years ago, I read about collaborations between zCash and Ethereum dev teams to bring private transactions to Ethereum.

Nowadays, I still read a lot about zkSNARKs on Ethereum, but for a different purpose: scalability.

But what is the state of private transactions on Ethereum ? Is it still being developed ? Is it already there ? Or will it come ""for free"" with L2 zkSNARKs ? Or is it just put behind because scalability is a more pressing matter ?

I'm surprised that this is not really discussed (or maybe I'm just missing it in the flood). For example, what would be the regulatory implications ?

ethereum,What am I buying ?,"What am I buying?

Hi guys, new person here. I‚Äôm really trying to wrap my head around crypto and recently got onto looking deeper with each coin. What I‚Äôm stuck on is this:

1. . For a truly all encompassing system, by what mechanism can tokens be recouped when they‚Äôre lost via other means ? Eg inheritance, person dies, or loses their wallet etc

While I understand the whole point is anonymity/trustlessness to an extent, if I lost all my bank cards etc and forgot my bank PIN I can still use my identity documents to go and regain access to my bank account. Same with a death, the will or the State will transfer assets to next of kin normally even if not listed or they can claim
It. 

How does ETH or any other crypto for that matter attempt to solve this? because it does need to be solved if the aim is for mass, worldwide societal adoption",1622846757,MrAcademics,True,1,3,2021-06-05

I am especially trying to understand the Ethereum is not safe part of the statement. What safety feature is Cardano criticizing about Ethereum???

Another criticism of Cardano from is especially their statement.

*"" Current credentials issuance and verification systems are inherently  flawed. Document and control remains with the issuer, rather than the  individual, for example, which creates a strong dependency on  third-party agencies to verify the document‚Äôs authenticity.

Maybe the next trusted would be my wife and my mom, then acquaintances and chain of personalities and identities in my social circles.

As a programmer when I look at Cardano development options I really sit on the sidelines.

ethereum,"My unedited, uncensored thoughts about Ethereum, Cardano, Tezos, formal proofs and functional programming being a gimmick","**Warning: this post is a huge wall of unedited thoughts. **

When browsing [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nru5kh/cardano_founder_blocked_me_i_wonder_why/) on this subreddit, I've noticed a comment about Cardano from /u/Theory-Early, who wrote:

&gt; I dont think it sounds promising at all. 99.99% of all programmers do not give a single fuck about functional programming or formal verification. it's literally a gimmick to scam non-programmers with an ICO.

&gt; programmers aren't attracted to cardano, only fucking retarded investors who think functional programming and formal verification is some magic bullet.

First of all, Cardano is a mess that does **not** represent how a functional blockchain should be made. But I'll talk about this subject later. For now, I'd like to talk about the ""FP is a gimmick"" part. Rather than getting offended and discard /u/Theory-Early as someone who just ""doesn't get it"" (like most FP elitists would probably do), this inspires me to really understand where this perception comes from, evaluate its merits and wonder what could be done to change it. This isn't just an isolated case. When I was developing Formality, I've felt that impression coming from many of you, and I know many of you feel that way. Rightfully so, ok? It is my job to understand this feeling, its roots, and figure out how to change it.

It is true that functional programming and formal verification has certain fame of being over-hyped tools that, in the end, provide little to no practical benefit. At the same time, those who do get it ultimately fall in love and almost universally come to the conclusion that it is objectively, profoundly superior to the alternatives. Isn't that weird? Why there is such a huge disconnect between people who ""get it"" think it is the best thing ever, and everyone else, who just watches from the outside and judges it as a useless gimmick?

I think both sides have a fair judgement. The thing is, when you, in a personal level, learn about FP, you instantly realize how good it is. It is obvious for you, because all the tools it directly provides you objectively make you a better programmer, today. You get access to abstractions like functors, monads, folds, composition, a next-gen type-system. Learning to use these things properly makes you so much better that you wonder how you could ever lived so long without those things. And then you start preaching about how amazing FP is. And write about burritos. **And ultimately proceed to build nothing of real value.**

Ah, that happens sooo often. But why? If FP is so objectively better, where are all the cool things built with it? I have a simple answer to that paradox, but it might make some people really upset with me: **Haskell isn't a practical language.** And that's all.

See, there are some practical FP languages like Scala and Clojure, but these are practical exactly because of all the non-FP concepts mixed in. They are hybrid, multi-paradigm languages. So that doesn't count as a solid argument in favor of FP. When it comes to fully embracing FP, there is only one mature language in the market: Haskell. And that language isn't practical. Simple as that. I hope that doesn't make /r/haskell upset with me, but, as much as I love it, it isn't.

1. Haskell has possibly the worst package manager in the world. It is not just bad, it is terrible. As in, ""can't install more than 3 libs without breaking the world"" terrible. It is so bad the community had to create a second package manager that maintains a curated list of packages that work in conjunction. Which kinda works, but 1. requires a ton of work, 2. doesn't scale and 3. still breaks if you need to install anything outside of that curated list.

2. Its error messages are sometimes great, sometimes completely cryptic. Problem is: it takes just one cryptic messages to waste hours of your time. Even worse, in the end, often it isn't even your fault. Which takes us to...

3. A messy soup of package extensions that is required to make up for the lack of dependent types. Sooner or later, something you need to do will not work just because Haskell can't understand it. And then you'll need to add extensions like RankNTypes, GADTs, FlexibleInstances, ScopedTypeVariables, and eventually you're coding in a frankenstein dialect with error messages that not even the author understands.

4. Too many obscure, academic words that exist for historical reasons (or no good reason). This only further isolates the community in a bubble. If a word requires explaining, it isn't a good word. A programmer shouldn't learn a whole new vocabulary to just get started. Things like: why isn't Functor called Mappeable?

5. The idiomatic syntax isn't very practical. For example, a `fold` is beautiful when the body is short, but when it is large, it requires you to indent your code in bizarre ways. See [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/nd9j7c/what_are_you_hyped_about_today/gya62ji/) comment for an example. The acclaimed point-free style often leads to unreadable one-liners that do 1000 things. The equational notation for function declaration becomes redundant once you have many arguments, and it doesn't scale vertically. Monads are a genius, profound way to handle effects... once you spend a semester learning about them and getting overwhelmed by the awful or plain wrong tutorials. Pattern-matching records with many fields requires you to rename all fields, every single time. Extracting big or deep fields is extremely verbose, almost forcing you to deal with lenses. Which then require another semester of courses, 10's of cryptic symbols, and once you do it, have fun with your 10x performance penalty. And then you miss the times when you could just write `foo.bar.x.y += 3`.

6. Finally, and perhaps mostly, its failure to compete on the front-end, user-facing space. There is still no viable JS compiler, no satisfactory way to make iOS/Android apps, or Windows/OSX/Linux releases. 

In short, what I'm saying is that Haskell is a very unpractical language out of the box, and that it is a major contributor to this perception that FP is a gimmick. And don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on Haskell, it is still one of my favorite languages, and it **can** be extremely powerful for an individual or isolate team with enough time. But I truly don't think it is going to, say, replace TypeScript anytime soon. It just doesn't scale, community-wise. And what is the point of being a god-like programmer, in a language that few use? Only to get beat by a CS freshman who just installed a `npm` package that does what he wanted?

But FP, as a concept... that's a different matter. It has a lot of potential, and I don't think anybody will be able to judge it until they truly get it. So, this sparks the question: what would happen if we had an catual hardcore functional language, with all the power of Haskell, but none of its practical problems? I.e., one that would be as easy to learn as TypeScript? One that would strip away all the academic jargon, one with amazing error messages, one with an easy, obvious ways to anything you do in conventional languages (effects, field updates, loops)? One that, like TypeScript, was ready to scale into a massive ecosystem of real-world applications? Yet, one that, under the hoods, was grounded on the solid foundations of type theory, with dependent types, formal proofs and all that powerful stuff waiting for you, when - and if - you're ready for it? If we had such a language, what would happen? Would the common developer still dismiss FP as a weird thing of weird people, or would they suddenly realize the immense power that FP has, and fall in love? I honestly, deeply, strongly, think the later would happen.

Am I right? Am I wrong? Well, for one, we could almost see that happening a few years ago, powered by another language: Elm. It did just some of the things I sad, and the result was clear, as it quickly grew to be one of the most used functional languages. But it had a big issue: it simplified things so much, it ended up shallow. Once you learned enough and started needing the additional power, it wasn't there. The language was too limited to do certain things. So the hype eventually died off. But do you really need to overly simplify the core language in order to make it simple? No! I don't think so. You can just be careful to get these things out of the way of the common developer, and that can be accomplished by serving the common developer a familiar syntax that is just enough for him to thrive. The advanced stuff can still be accessible for those who want it.

This line of thought is what ultimately lead me to build Formality, now named [Kind](https://github.com/uwu-tech/kind). Kind is **the** language being developed with the main purpose of becoming the ultimate functional language that can scale to the wide market, maintaining all the power of Haskell, fixing its mistakes, bringing powerful concepts from proof languages and keeping itself approachable, efficient. Are we there yet? Honestly, I think we are. At least, very close. A solid foundation? Check. Performance? Check. Can it be used by normal developers to build real stuff? Well, in the last few months, I've made an experiment. I've hired about 5 individuals with little or no programming experience, taught them Kind, and asked them to build a game and left. 3 months after, they're almost done building an engine with rollback netcode, a graphics framework, a reactive user interface, state computations based on stream of events. They're dealing with monads, folds, dependent types. And they just keep building and giving, not ever getting stuck or feeling hopeless. I truly think no other proof language has accomplished anything like that.

So, why this big wall of text, here on /r/ethereum? I actually don't know. I guess I had too much to say, and I wanted to vent. I do feel a little anxious when I see idiots getting so much voice and attention, but nothing gets me more than projects that have no substance or fundamentals getting treated as if they were somehow profound. Doge deserves its spot, it has a foundation, for being a meme, for being cute, for challenging the seriousness of money. But Cardano? What is its foundation? It sells itself as a more functional, research-based alternative to Ethereum. So, please, can anyone tell me one thing Cardano does, that Kind+Ethereum doesn't do much better? It makes me upset to see people dismissing FP as a whole, because of a project with no real substance, that promises to change the world, yet can't deliver smart-contracts after half a decade of existence. I think Cardano is a big disservice for the FP community.

When it comes to formally verified smart-contracts, Kind+Ethereum is all we ever need. And, no, I'm not saying formal proofs are a silver bullet for security, but I do think it will massively improve the issue, and I promise eventually you'll get it. But how? For some time, I thought it'd be a matter of compiling Kind to the EVM. That would allow you to write normal Kind programs and run them inside Ethereum. I don't think that is a great idea anymore. The gas overhead of compiling lambdas, [as little as we make them](https://medium.com/@maiavictor/compiling-formality-to-the-evm-99aec75677dd), is still superior to 0. In a network where every opcode costs a fortune, people would just write in a cheaper, less safe language. And, in reality, smart-contracts are often simple and don't require all the features you have in Kind. 

So, for now, the plan is to just create a SmartContract DSL on Kind, with a reasonable syntax sugar, that will allow people to write Ethereum smart-contracts embedded on it. They'll then be able to easily deploy, monitor and prove things about these contracts. Simple, easy and effective. Sure, this **is** something that can be done on Agda, Idris, Coq too. And perhaps that is why I've avoided this solution for a while. But, honestly? That is the way to go. And these are not practical languages either, I don't think they'll ever have massive ecosystems, so doing it in Kind will enable formally verified smart-contracts for the masses, which is something new. Now, please, tell me: once Kind is popular, has a great ecosystem, and people can easily write, deploy and verify Ethereum smart-contracts on it... **then what is even the point of Cardano anymore?** In what technical sense it even needs to exist? It doesn't scale better than Ethereum, the built-in forking stuff is an actual gimmick, and it isn't safer or more functional in any way. So I honestly can't find a reason. If anyone has a great answer to that question, let me know, because I've been waiting for years and there is none.

To be clear, I don't want to sound like a hater. I'm not lying when I say I love when I'm proven wrong, because I can cut losses and stop wasting my time in a wrong idea (just be Kind, please). But for now, I can't look at Cardano and not think: what is the point? Or, rather: why people are so hyped about something that is, in my head, objectively inferior to what I'm building? Am I that out of touch? I'm just trying to understand. What Cardano does? The best arguments I've found so far are that:

1. ""Haskell is safer than Solidity."" Fair. But Kind is much safer than Haskell. By a large margin. Is there anyone who disagrees with that? So, are you telling me that Cardano built an entire network, with the whole premise of being ""a safer, more functional"" alternative to Ethereum, only to be obsolete as soon as an actual proof language adds support to Ethereum smart-contracts? Or are they betting that a proof language like Kind will never be popular enough to be viable? Or that people will never realize Haskell doesn't even have formal proofs? 

2. ""Our virtual-machine language is easier to reason about."" Fair. But a DSL in Kind, that compiles to the EVM, can also be made very easy to reason about. There is no need to create a whole network around that. Now, to be clear, I still think compiling Kind to its own INet-based ""functional virtual machine"" is a fucking amazing idea. **That** would justify building its own, separate blockchain, because the **cost model** is so beautifully great. But that's a lot of work, and NOT what Cardano is proposing. 

To be fair, I could be really misunderstanding something, since Cardano smart-contracts aren't even written in Haskell, and it is still not clear to me what is the actual language used for it. Is it Plutus? Is it Marlowe? What is the execution environment that every full node runs? Is it a stack-machine? Are there lambdas? What are the opcodes? Where is the cost table? Is there even one? How much a beta-reduction costs? How do they measure that? Perhaps I'm too dumb to get it, but, I mean, if I can't get it, how do they expect everyone will? It has been years and I still don't get Cardano. And I swear I'm not lazy, I've tried. For a comparison, it took me a 5 minutes to open Ethereum's yellow paper and immediately get its point.

ethereum,"My unedited, uncensored thoughts about Ethereum, Cardano, Tezos, formal proofs and functional programming being a gimmick","**Warning: this post is an unedited stream of thoughts. **

When browsing [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nru5kh/cardano_founder_blocked_me_i_wonder_why/) on this subreddit, I've found a post about Cardano from /u/Theory-Early, who wrote:

&gt; I dont think it sounds promising at all. 99.99% of all programmers do not give a single fuck about functional programming or formal verification. it's literally a gimmick to scam non-programmers with an ICO.

&gt; programmers aren't attracted to cardano, only fucking retarded investors who think functional programming and formal verification is some magic bullet.

First of all, Cardano is a mess that does **not** represent how a functional blockchain should be made. But I'll talk about this subject later. For now, I'd like to talk about the ""FP is a gimmick"" part. Rather than getting offended and discard /u/Theory-Early as someone who just ""doesn't get it"" (like most FP elitists would probably do), this inspires me to really understand where this perception comes from, evaluate its merits and wonder what could be done to change it. This isn't just an isolated case. When I was developing Formality, I've felt that impression coming from many of you, and I know many of you feel that way. Rightfully so, ok? It is my job to understand this feeling, its roots, and figure out how to change it.

It is true that functional programming and formal verification has certain fame of being over-hyped tools that, in the end, provide little to no practical benefit. At the same time, those who do get it ultimately fall in love and almost universally come to the conclusion that it is objectively, profoundly superior to the alternatives. Isn't that weird? Why there is such a huge disconnect between people who ""get it"" think it is the best thing ever, and everyone else, who just watches from the outside and judges it as a useless gimmick?

I think both sides have a fair judgement. The thing is, when you, in a personal level, learn about FP, you instantly realize how good it is. It is obvious for you, because all the tools it directly provides you objectively make you a better programmer, today. You get access to abstractions like functors, monads, folds, composition, a next-gen type-system. Learning to use these things properly makes you so much better that you wonder how you could ever lived so long without those things. And then you start preaching about how amazing FP is. And write about burritos. **And ultimately proceed to build nothing of real value.**

Ah, that happens sooo often. But why? If FP is so objectively better, where are all the cool things built with it? I have a simple answer to that paradox, but it might make some people really upset with me: **Haskell isn't a practical language.** And that's all.

See, there are some practical FP languages like Scala and Clojure, but these are practical exactly because of all the non-FP concepts mixed in. They are hybrid, multi-paradigm languages. So that doesn't count as a solid argument in favor of FP. When it comes to fully embracing FP, there is only one mature language in the market: Haskell. And that language isn't practical. Simple as that. I hope that doesn't make /r/haskell upset with me, but, as much as I love it, it isn't.

1. Haskell has possibly the worst package manager in the world. It is not just bad, it is terrible. As in, ""can't install more than 3 libs without breaking the world"" terrible. It is so bad the community had to create a second package manager that maintains a curated list of packages that work in conjunction. Which kinda works, but 1. requires a ton of work, 2. doesn't scale and 3. still breaks if you need to install anything outside of that curated list.

2. Its error messages are sometimes great, sometimes completely cryptic. Problem is: it takes just one cryptic messages to waste hours of your time. Even worse, in the end, often it isn't even your fault. Which takes us to...

3. A messy soup of package extensions that is required to make up for the lack of dependent types. Sooner or later, something you need to do will not work just because Haskell can't understand it. And then you'll need to add extensions like RankNTypes, GADTs, FlexibleInstances, ScopedTypeVariables, and eventually you're coding in a frankenstein dialect with error messages that not even the author understands.

4. Too many obscure, academic words that exist for historical reasons (or no good reason). This only further isolates the community in a bubble. If a word requires explaining, it isn't a good word. A programmer shouldn't learn a whole new vocabulary to just get started. Things like: why isn't Functor called Mappeable?

5. The idiomatic syntax isn't very practical. For example, a `fold` is beautiful when the body is short, but when it is large, it requires you to indent your code in bizarre ways. See [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/nd9j7c/what_are_you_hyped_about_today/gya62ji/) comment for an example. The acclaimed point-free style often leads to unreadable one-liners that do 1000 things. The equational notation for function declaration becomes redundant once you have many arguments, and it doesn't scale vertically. Monads are a genius, profound way to handle effects... once you spend a semester learning about them and getting overwhelmed by the awful or plain wrong tutorials. Pattern-matching records with many fields requires you to rename all fields, every single time. Extracting big or deep fields is extremely verbose, almost forcing you to deal with lenses. Which then require another semester of courses, 10's of cryptic symbols, and once you do it, have fun with your 10x performance penalty. And then you miss the times when you could just write `foo.bar.x.y += 3`.

6. Finally, and perhaps mostly, its failure to compete on the front-end, user-facing space. There is still no viable JS compiler, no satisfactory way to make iOS/Android apps, or Windows/OSX/Linux releases. 

In short, what I'm saying is that Haskell is a very unpractical language out of the box, and that it is a major contributor to this perception that FP is a gimmick. And don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on Haskell, it is still one of my favorite languages, and it **can** be extremely powerful for an individual or isolate team with enough time. But I truly don't think it is going to, say, replace TypeScript anytime soon. It just doesn't scale, community-wise. And what is the point of being a god-like programmer, in a language that few use? Only to get beat by a CS freshman who just installed a `npm` package that does what he wanted?

But FP, as a concept... that's a different matter. It has a lot of potential, and I don't think anybody will be able to judge it until they truly get it. So, this sparks the question: what would happen if we had an catual hardcore functional language, with all the power of Haskell, but none of its practical problems? I.e., one that would be as easy to learn as TypeScript? One that would strip away all the academic jargon, one with amazing error messages, one with an easy, obvious ways to anything you do in conventional languages (effects, field updates, loops)? One that, like TypeScript, was ready to scale into a massive ecosystem of real-world applications? Yet, one that, under the hoods, was grounded on the solid foundations of type theory, with dependent types, formal proofs and all that powerful stuff waiting for you, when - and if - you're ready for it? If we had such a language, what would happen? Would the common developer still dismiss FP as a weird thing of weird people, or would they suddenly realize the immense power that FP has, and fall in love? I honestly, deeply, strongly, think the later would happen.

Am I right? Am I wrong? Well, for one, we could almost see that happening a few years ago, powered by another language: Elm. It did just some of the things I sad, and the result was clear, as it quickly grew to be one of the most used functional languages. But it had a big issue: it simplified things so much, it ended up shallow. Once you learned enough and started needing the additional power, it wasn't there. The language was too limited to do certain things. So the hype eventually died off. But do you really need to overly simplify the core language in order to make it simple? No! I don't think so. You can just be careful to get these things out of the way of the common developer, and that can be accomplished by serving the common developer a familiar syntax that is just enough for him to thrive. The advanced stuff can still be accessible for those who want it.

This line of thought is what ultimately lead me to build Formality, now named [Kind](https://github.com/uwu-tech/kind). Kind is **the** language being developed with the main purpose of becoming the ultimate functional language that can scale to the wide market, maintaining all the power of Haskell, fixing its mistakes, bringing powerful concepts from proof languages and keeping itself approachable, efficient. Are we there yet? Honestly, I think we are. At least, very close. A solid foundation? Check. Performance? Check. Can it be used by normal developers to build real stuff? Well, in the last few months, I've made an experiment. I've hired about 5 individuals with little or no programming experience, taught them Kind, and asked them to build a game and left. 3 months after, they're almost done building an engine with rollback netcode, a graphics framework, a reactive user interface, state computations based on stream of events. They're dealing with monads, folds, dependent types. And they just keep building and giving, not ever getting stuck or feeling hopeless. I truly think no other proof language has accomplished anything like that.

So, why this big wall of text, here on /r/ethereum? I actually don't know. I guess I had too much to say, and I wanted to vent. I do feel a little anxious when I see idiots getting so much voice and attention, but nothing gets me more than projects that have no substance or fundamentals getting treated as if they were somehow profound. Doge deserves its spot, it has a foundation, for being a meme, for being cute, for challenging the seriousness of money. But Cardano? What is its foundation? It sells itself as a more functional, research-based alternative to Ethereum. So, please, can anyone tell me one thing Cardano does, that Kind+Ethereum doesn't do much better? It makes me upset to see people dismissing FP as a whole, because of a project with no real substance, that promises to change the world, yet can't deliver smart-contracts after half a decade of existence. I think Cardano is a big disservice for the FP community.

When it comes to formally verified smart-contracts, Kind+Ethereum is all we ever need. And, no, I'm not saying formal proofs are a silver bullet for security, but I do think it will massively improve the issue, and I promise eventually you'll get it. But how? For some time, I thought it'd be a matter of compiling Kind to the EVM. That would allow you to write normal Kind programs and run them inside Ethereum. I don't think that is a great idea anymore. The gas overhead of compiling lambdas, [as little as we make them](https://medium.com/@maiavictor/compiling-formality-to-the-evm-99aec75677dd), is still superior to 0. In a network where every opcode costs a fortune, people would just write in a cheaper, less safe language. And, in reality, smart-contracts are often simple and don't require all the features you have in Kind. 

So, for now, the plan is to just create a SmartContract DSL on Kind, with a reasonable syntax sugar, that will allow people to write Ethereum smart-contracts embedded on it. They'll then be able to easily deploy, monitor and prove things about these contracts. Simple, easy and effective. Sure, this **is** something that can be done on Agda, Idris, Coq too. And perhaps that is why I've avoided this solution for a while. But, honestly? That is the way to go. And these are not practical languages either, I don't think they'll ever have massive ecosystems, so doing it in Kind will enable formally verified smart-contracts for the masses, which is something new. Now, please, tell me: once Kind is popular, has a great ecosystem, and people can easily write, deploy and verify Ethereum smart-contracts on it... **then what is even the point of Cardano anymore?** In what technical sense it even needs to exist? It doesn't scale better than Ethereum, I honestly can't find a reason. If anyone has a great answer to that question, let me know, because I've been waiting for years and there is none.

To be clear, I don't want to sound like a hater. I'm not lying when I say I love when I'm proven wrong, because I can cut losses and stop wasting my time in a wrong idea (just be Kind, please). But for now, I can't look at Cardano and not think: what is the point? Or, rather: why people are so hyped about something that is, in my head, objectively inferior to what I'm building? Am I that out of touch? I'm just trying to understand. What Cardano does? The best arguments I've found so far are that:

1. ""Haskell is safer than Solidity."" Fair. But Kind is much safer than Haskell. By a large margin. Is there anyone who disagrees with that? So, are you telling me that Cardano built an entire network, with the whole premise of being ""a safer, more functional"" alternative to Ethereum, only to be obsolete as soon as an actual proof language adds support to Ethereum smart-contracts? Or are they betting that a proof language like Kind will never be popular enough to be viable? Or that people will never realize Haskell doesn't even have formal proofs? 

2. ""Our virtual-machine language is easier to reason about."" Fair. But a DSL in Kind, that compiles to the EVM, can also be made very easy to reason about. There is no need to create a whole network around that. Now, to be clear, I still think compiling Kind to its own INet-based ""functional virtual machine"" is a fucking amazing idea. **That** would justify building its own, separate blockchain, because the **cost model** is so beautifully great. But that's a lot of work, and NOT what Cardano is proposing. 

To be fair, I could be really misunderstanding something, since Cardano smart-contracts aren't even written in Haskell, and it is still not clear to me what is the actual language used for it. Is it Plutus? Is it Marlowe? What is the execution environment that every full node runs? Is it a stack-machine? Are there lambdas? What are the opcodes? Where is the cost table? Is there even one? How much a beta-reduction costs? How do they measure that? Perhaps I'm too dumb to get it, but, I mean, if I can't get it, how do they expect everyone will? It has been years and I still don't get Cardano. And I swear I'm not lazy, I've tried. For a comparison, it took me a 5 minutes to open Ethereum's yellow paper and immediately get its point.

Anyway, these are my un-edited thoughts about all these things, for whoever this may interest. About Kind, soon we'll be back with a bunch of cool things to show. I just hope people give us some space to show these things! If Cardano deserves a $54b network, we deserve some attention. It is so sad to see crap getting so much attention, while people building real stuff get ignored. But, fair enough, the market decides what it wants. For now, we'll keep building.

ethereum,ERC20 and non-ERC20 Wallet Security," I'm looking for some **signal to cut the noise**, since most guides, blogs and articles are trying to push some arbitrary choice of wallet. So please, reply on the basis of your own experience and if possible on the basis of trusted information.

To store BTC most people know how to setup a secure cold wallet. For ETH and ERC20 my understanding is that MEW can be used to create a cold wallet too.

Please do not submit plain superficial answers suggesting a random wallet like Exodus or Trust. If you do use something like that, please state what are the specifics of creating a safe environment around it.

Please consider that I (and most people seriously talking about security and privacy) can run Tails, Qubes, Tor and other security measures if required.

Due to country restrictions acquiring hardware with Secureboot/Heads is not an option right now. A hardware wallet is not an option right now, due to the same reason, unless there is a safe DIY solution.

Questions are:

* For non ERC20 tokens, what safe wallet do you use/recommend?
* Your suggestion allows for the creation of a cold wallet?
* If hot only, why choosing it and what key security measures are you using?
* For ERC20 tokens, do you use/recommend anything beyond MEW for cold storage?
* If not, are you using hot wallets for ERC20 and ETH? Why choosing it and what key security measures are you using?

&gt;Do your own research.

That's what I'm doing Einstein, this is just another good place to gather information.

Sorry if anything came out rude, I'm trying to be objective and the community deserves better than random blog posts and HODL memes.

If ever I'm satisfied with security architecture and wallet choice for people stuck in similar situation, I'll update the topic with all relevant information.

ethereum,What's the benefits of web3 beyond decentralization and privacy?,"I've been doing a deep dive into ethereum. I came across web3 and it's really cool. I just see a huge down side in the cost of it. So for me to use web sites/web apps I need to pay a steady supply of gas fees? The big benefit seems to be privacy and decentralization. Like how 90% of the internet is being run on Azure or AWS right now. 

What other benefits are there that I'm not picking up? I'm currently exploring how to set up and browse dapps so I might have a better understanding once I see what kind of apps people are building. I love the idea but it's really difficult for me to get on board with the premise that my wallet will slowly get drained as I browse/interact with the internet with the only benefit being decentralization and privacy.",1622787025,theNeumannArchitect,True,1,3,2021-06-04

ethereum,Ethereum Vs. Solana: Design philosophy,"Disclaimer: This post is focused on theoretical paradigms and not practicality. If that's not your thing just move on, this is not for you.

There are a lot of conversations about which blockchain is best. Most would point to Solana's TPS being game changing. Incredibly fast transactions, cheap fees.

They usually don't like to talk about the cost, which is that the Solana chain will theoretically not be able to match Ethereum's security and decentralization, which for many future blockchain applications is more important than speed.

While most chains are simply copying Ethertheum's paradigm, never coming close to attaining the most important aspect for the blockchain, locked in value, Solana is functioning on an actual original paradigm, to maximize the use of computational resources to process a blockchain.

**Proposition:** The primary value to reflect the security of a chain is the amount of value locked in and the amount of validators for the network.

Ethereum's  primary goal was to create a wide spread Turing complete consensus network. This design involves as little computational demand as possible while still maintaining a standard to achieve as much adoption as possible.

Solana's primary goal was to maximize the limitations of a computer in a Turing complete consensus network. This design involves as much parallel processing and efficient data propagation as computationally possible to achieve maximum theoretical network ability.

**The most important aspect of a blockchain is security but security/speed ratio is the bottleneck for blockchains.** This means in a perfect world where there is infinite computer resources and locked in value, Solana's paradigm is superior because it maximizes resources and resources are plentiful and everything is already secure. Note, We should also consider that Ethereum employs a 51% rule while Solana a 33% in a true technical comparison but this is mainly theoretical and for arguments sake we will just equate(reduce speed to make equal) and ignore this as its not the point of the post.

In a realistic world, Ethereum is superior. This is because there is still so much value in the world not in Ethereum so having locked in value and greater accessibility is more important for mass adoption.

What this means is that Ethereum is building the world's network but sacrificing maximum speed. Having a network focused on speed instead of security will then always be useful because there are processes where performance values speed over security at a certain level.

Ethereum's design philosophy is more important for the near future of blockchain. Solana's design philosophy is for the long term future of blockchain and will help make up for Ethereum's short term faults. Ethereum could theoretically employ Solana designs in the far future when base computers have progressed enough but this would be in a utopia. As Solana can make up for Ethereum's short coming's right now and vice-versa, applications that prefer speed, like trading, can use Solana for higher performance when required.

**Solana actually serves a unique purpose in an Ethereum dominated world while many current blockchains will not have a legitimate unique purpose.**",1622763894,Whitestickyman,True,1,3,2021-06-04

ethereum,"Hi everyone, need some brainstorming help...","I‚Äôm an independent filmmaker.  I‚Äôm in preproduction for a short proof of concept right now and my grand idea is to release the final edit either 1. on blockchain as an NFT, or 2. somehow have a paywall and verify a blockchain payment to gain access to a ‚Äúdigital theater‚Äù hosted on our website.

My goal is to progress the ecosystem and allow people to enjoy crypto directly for purchases and I believe it will help get our film (which I‚Äôm working very hard on) seen by the most people.

If this is successful, I‚Äôd like to somehow create a blockchain ‚Äútheater‚Äù DAO that is a marketplace for films.

I‚Äôm not a developer so how hard would either option be?  It is important to me for people to be able to see the film on a large screen like a home theater easily...so not sure if an NFT could be played back effortlessly or if it could even handle that large of a file format.

ethereum,A case for $SHINU,"I'm going to get into $SHINU in a moment, but I wanted to say something first. I've come to realize many of us, myself included, have been dealing with a lot this past year (loss of self esteem, anxiety, depression, loss of loved ones, loss of job of home, family and friends passing away, etc). If you are going through some things as well, and would like to talk about it or just be part of a community that shares, please come visit. Regardless of whether or not you want to join the $SHINU Family and the Project. I'm amazed every day by the amount of compassion and how uplifting this community of strangers are to everyone in it.

Alright, now for why you came.

$SHINU

- Currently only on Uniswap, though with plans to fork in the future.
- Two weeks old, and still under a million market cap. ATH was six days ago, and about 500% from where we are now. Some early whales who weren't there for the project all left so our distribution is much better, and our holder count has tripled, since they exited.
- Tokenomics involve an 8% transaction tax. 4% for redistribution and 4% for marketing.
- No paid marketing has been done, as we want to stick to strictly organic growth until we hit some milestones, which I will list below.
   - listed on CG and CM (applied)
   - 3 other additional listings (2/3 done)
   - Interactive prototype of portfolio up ‚úÖ
   - Interactive prototype of the DEX up (eta 3 days)
   - 1,000 holders (mid 641)
   - 1,000 TG members (584)
- The reason we are sticking to organic growth until this point in time is that all of us who get in now are true believers in the project and will HODL until a 500 million MC. We don't want pump and dumpers, or mean whales, hurting the project.
- Dev and team do multiple AMA voice chats with the team weekly to update on everything going on, as well as to answer any questions members have.
- Both Dev wallets are only 1%, the rest was a true fair launch.
- Reddit, TG, Twitter, accounts are both active, and the community is active on those and IG, Facebook, 4chan, etc.
- the DEX is being built around a new code. This will automatically audit all tokens on application to prevent scam tokens, like honeypots, from being listed.
- If one is applied for, or slips through (new codes always have kinks to work out), the dev behind it is permanently blacklisted from the DEX for that project, as well as all their future projects.
- DEX will also have an customizable UI that links with all the other $SHINU projects. Think having dextools chart, Uniswaps trading ability, and the profit/loss tracker from Zerion all on one screen.
- Very active community, and the team delivers on their promises. Before we were two weeks old, the in interactive tracker prototype was up. The interactive DEX prototype is going to be up before we even hit three weeks.

ethereum,An Ethereum Community Story from the Crypto Baron,"I'm sure the over-whelming majority of the community will not remember me (I used to make videos on Ethereum and crypto currency in 2017 like so many others lol), but I wanted to give a heartfelt thank you to all.  In 2016, I was fortunate enough to discover Ethereum while finishing my MBA.  Having an understanding of bitcoin and blockchain technology, it was obvious that this was a special project from the get-go.  Granted, I've lost much of my initial Ethereum along the way (some foolish and some even good ICOs that haven't paced in value or openly exit scammed... and in my LEAST proud moment, I was even scammed out of 100 ether in 2017), but this community has largely understood what they've HODL'd... a nearly invaluable resource.  Despite the growth in price and value, I have HODL'd from $8 to $4300 and remain happily running validators as we TEMPORARILY slip back down to $2500-2800.

The point of this story is that with just 1 ether purchased at $8, I was able to fund an entire online business I just launched with a supplementary goal of raising money for US Veterans (I, myself, am a Marine Corps Iraq war veteran)--while separating myself from even 1 ether breaks my heart, I'm comforted knowing my validators will make it back and continue contributing to the network.  Further, this is a way I feel I can continue to contribute to the ecosystem as a non-coder... because you can bet your ass we accept payments in Ethereum and you can bet your ass instead of transferring it to cash, I'll HODL that shit as tightly as I did from $8-4300.

Anyway, check us out at [SemperFly.us](https://SemperFly.us) if you want... if not, no worries, keep killing it as a community.  I'll be here, lurking and looking for anyways to help that I can.

ethereum,Borrowing using Crypto as Collateral: My Experiences and Findings,"As tax day in the U.S (5/17) quickly crept up on me, I found myself in a predicament: I was crypto rich but cash poor and did not have enough dollars to pay my taxes. This led me to doing research on how to borrow using crypto as collateral for I was trying to avoid selling crypto to pay taxes, which in turn would trigger more taxes.  Here are my findings below:

Since crypto is an extremely volatile asset and there is no yet established credit system in the crypto lending space, meaning crypto-backed loans are all over-collateralized. Most cases, the Loan to Value Ratio (LTV) ranges from 20%-50%. LTV = Loan Amount/Collateral Value. So to borrow 10k with a loan with LTV value at 50%, you would need to put up 20k in crypto value as collateral. 

&amp;#x200B;

**BlockFi**: Custodial crypto company which offers services including trading, borrowing and earning interest on crypto deposits. 

Loan: 10k minimum loan, acceptable forms of collateral: BTC, ETC, LTC, and PAXG, only allows monthly payments for interest (monthly payments are much lower but you will owe entire principal at the end), collateral must maintain 70% of value or will require more collateral 

Rates:

LTV: 20%, Interest Rate: 4.50% (Only available with BTC)

LTV: 35%; Interest Rate: 7.90% 

LTV: 50%; Interest Rate: 9.75% 

Pros: 

\-Loan direct deposit into bank account

\-No protocol hack risk

Cons: 

\-Limited cryptos accepted as collateral 

\-KYC 

\- Legally binding contract for loan, must adhere to BlockFi‚Äôs terms 

&amp;#x200B;

**Salt Lending**: Founded in 2016, Salt was one of the first companies to introduce crypto-backed lending. Salt currently offers institutional-grade crypto custody and blockchain monitoring products as well. 

Loan: 5k minimum, 1m max; acceptable forms of collateral: BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, SALT, Paxos, USDC, TrueUSD, PAXG, 3-12 month loan duration, option to pay interest only or principal and interest, ability to redeem SALT tokens to lower interest rates (SALT currently \~30c)

Rates:

LTV: 30%, Interest Rate: 2.95% - 4.95% (2.95% available if 272.1 SALT is redeemed)

LTV: 40%, Interest Rate: 5.95% - 7.95% (5.95% available if 272.1 SALT is redeemed)

LTV: 50%, Interest Rate: 10.95% - 12.95% (10.95% available if 272.1 SALT is redeemed)

LTV: 60%, Interest Rate: 15.95% - 17.95% (10.95% available if 272.1 SALT is redeemed)

Pros: 

\-more reasonable rates with the SALT redemption 

\-loan direct deposit into bank account

\-no protocol hack risk

Cons:

\-availability varies (really only available in the US. Outside US, Canada, UK and Australia are business only; Brazil, HK, New Zealand, UAE and Switzerland for individuals and business) 

\-KYC

\-must accept Salt‚Äôs terms and conditions 

&amp;#x200B;

**Celsius Network**: FinTech platform that offers interest-bearing savings accounts, borrowing, and payments with digital and fiat assets. 

Loan: $500 minimum to borrow stablecoins ($25k minimum for fiat except in NY and TX where min is $500); over 35 acceptable forms of collateral; 6 months to 3 year loan duration; monthly payments on interest only

Rates:

LTV: 25%, Interest Rate: 1.00% (.95% if you pay with CEL token)

LTV: 33%, Interest Rate: 6.95% (6.60% if you pay with CEL token)

LTV: 50%, Interest Rate: 8.95% (8.50% if you pay with CEL token)

Pros:

\-wider array of collateral accepted 

\-longer loan duration

\-lower min for stablecoin loan

Cons:

\-more KYC than other platforms (Government ID, Address, Tax ID)

\-primarily a phone app (can only borrow via phone app)

&amp;#x200B;

**MakerDAO/Oasis**: Autonomous protocol built on ETH blockchain that allows anyone to open up a smart contract/vault to deposit collateral and generate DAI. 

https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/MakerDAO

Loan: 5,000 DAI minimum (dust limit); wide range of ERC-20 tokens can be used as collateral (including LP tokens), no duration limit (in order to access collateral again, required to deposit DAI) 

Rates: 

Stability fee (interest rate) ranges depending on the token used. Balancer stability fee is 2.00%, AAVE is 3.00%, ETH is 5.00%. Most stability fees are 5.00%. Liquidation Fee is 13.00%. Non-stablecoin minimum collateralization ratio is around 150% (LTV of 66.7%) but that will risk liquidation for even slight down movement. Recommended collateralization ratio is 200%-300% (LTV of 33%-50%) 

Pros:

\-fully decentralized, No KYC, no restrictions 

\-wide range of collateral including some uniswap liquidity token

\-very competitive rates, fully flexible 

Cons: 

\-entirely up to the individual to understand and learn the process

\-if vault falls under liquidation ratio, it will automatically get liquidated so individual must be aware

\-gas fees on ETH network ( much more reasonable now) 

&amp;#x200B;

Although I did not end up borrowing, I am a fan of MakerDAO as an option. Not only are you getting very competitive rates, but also getting more flexibility and are contributing to the shift towards decentralization of finance. At its core, cryptocurrency is about financial freedom and empowerment through decentralization from traditional financial institutions, and MakerDAO encapsulates this. 

Please do not treat this as financial advice, but rather a starting grounds for your own research and DD for the best option for yourself. I hope this gives people a good overview of borrowing using crypto as collateral.",1622725060,zucchini_fries,True,1,22,2021-06-03

Ethereum mining will end especially after the transition to Ethereum 2.0, but the date for this is not yet clear. The fact that Ethereum miners have recently earned a significant income thanks to the increased transaction fees may have attracted the Norton team here.

Coinbase says that you will get 6% APR on your ETH which is great for people who have like 10+ ETH because getting 0.6+ ETH per year doing nothing is great. But when you get to 0.1 to 5 ETH is it not worth just to keep mining? Yeah people can keep the mining pools open and still collect that 1% from everyone that is using it and also stalk on the side. Unless I am missing something why would mining ETH be dead when 2.0 rolls around? From what I understand stalking will also be taxed. You have your ETH frozen for 1 year. Every article mentions  of a possibility of loosing ETH if something goes wrong.

ethereum,Will Ethereum need iExec to Scale?,"Ethereums current state struggles when performing rigorous computations efficiently and at reasonable cost.

Today, this isn‚Äôt really an issue because most dApps (Decentralized Applications) don‚Äôt have a working product. The dApps only utilize Ethereum for their ICO sale and for simple transactions with their tokens‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäEthereum is well suited for that. But once all these dApps start releasing actual products, with actual computational demands, Ethereum not only will not be able to keep up, but it will become prohibitively expensive. Since Ethereum charges ether (gas) to run the network, intensive computations would cost a fortune. Imagine when Ethereum‚Äôs computational demands increase by 10x, or 100x: the network will be unusable.

TLDR: Ethereum is great for simple computational processes like transactions. But the dApps on Ethereum need to do more. They need more power than the Ethereum virtual machine can provide.

The Solution

The solution to this is offchain computing. dApps need to be able to do their heavy computing offchain (meaning not on the Ethereum blockchain) and then bring the information and results back onto the Ethereum blockchain for verification. iExec enables just this. dApps can use iExec‚Äôs decentralized cloud computing services to safely, simply, and cheaply, execute their computation far from the inefficient and incapable Ethereum VM.

According to iExecs whitepaper they can make this system possible on a global scale. Including support for Fault Tolerance, multi-applications, multi-users, public/private infrastructure, deployment of virtual images data, data management, security and accountability, etc.

Example of dApps:

Flixxo - is a dApp that envisions itself as the decentralized YouTube. Because of all the encoding and decoding of videos on the blockchain, it requires an enormous amount of computer power. ‚ÄúiExec will allow the platform to do [this] by providing cloud resources,‚Äù

Request - is another partner. Request plans to offer automated auditing of financial records. This is also an extremely intensive computational process. iExec again provides the offchain solution for this computation‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe results of the audit can then be easily transferred to the Ethereum blockchain.

Users and businesses will also be able to utilize the iExec services for their own projects and uses. Need more power for your fantasy football algorithms? iExec can do that. Want to play Fifa with 4k settings? iExec is your tool.


For those out there. Cloud computing in general is a must have market. Google, IBM, Microsoft all provide cloud computing so companies that need access to processing power without having to maintain expensive technological infrastructures themselves. Companies like Netflix, Apple and Etzy all manage in cloud computing with these companies",1622601588,witthatgrip,True,1,4,2021-06-02

**‚ù§** [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/) will announce their Launch date during the call **‚ù§**

June 2nd, Wednesday 5.30 pm CET / 3.30 pm UTC / 11:30 am EST / 8:30 am PST

[Google Calendar Invite](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/eventedit/copy/dXJiYWV2MWkyc25zYWc4cGZsajhndWdxMmMgZGFvQHZpdGFkYW8uaW8/YXVkaWVsZW9uQGdtYWlsLmNvbQ?sf=true)

Zoom: [https://zoom.us/j/91895021387](https://zoom.us/j/91895021387)

* 5:30-5:40 Intro and Updates
* 5:40-6:00 Updates from Scheibye-Knudsen Lab
* 6:00-6:15 Q&amp;A Session

At the end of the call there will be a Q&amp;A session where you can ask your questions (via chat).  The call will be recorded and posted on [VitaDAO's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/vitadao). If any of your questions will not be answered due to time limitation - we will answer them on Discord after the call.

&amp;#x200B;

**If you don't know what** [**VitaDAO**](https://www.vitadao.com/) **is:** it's a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) coming together to fund and support the researchers and labs doing longevity science. Funding agreements will include ownership of IP (patents and research data) so we can monetize it (benefiting the researchers and allowing us to fund further research).

Goals of the organization:

* Fund promising research
* Make Longevity Science Intellectual Property and Data available on an open market
* Involve patients and researchers (and YOU!) in funding decisions through a DAO
* Build IP portfolio and monetize it

[VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/), in other words, wants to do the opposite of the current system, which sees longevity science research receive meager public funding, *maybe* result in a startup, and then get gobbled up by big pharma where the science is closed, patent protected, and profit driven. This system results in overpriced drugs based on dubious, unrepeatable science that downplays negative results in favor of profits. Another problem with the existing system is unprofitable existing drugs and treatments are ignored entirely, even if they have promise.

My computer started having a breakdown and I sent the private key to myself and factory reset the computer.  I then realized that this private key did not correspond to the address that had my tokens, and figured it must have been linked to a separate wallet (there were 3 distinct accounts in each wallet which provided different functions at that time).  I have recently been learning solidity and found out that these addresses could have been linked to one wallet.  Are these accounts randomly generated or could I generate two accounts on metamask and access the tokens?  I guess I'm asking whether there is a connection between these accounts that would be maintained even if I were to create new accounts for the address in metamask.  It will take a significant amount of effort to recover the key itself, so I am trying to figure this out beforehand.

Right now I‚Äôm trying to find information about investment into NFT art/collectables, but there‚Äôs not much guidance.¬†

I  found a few articles on that topic, but they seem to be very shallow  and don‚Äôt help that much. I do understand it‚Äôs a risky business, but I  believe there should be some ways to evaluate the artist or the artwork,  similar to how traditional art is evaluated.

Of  course, it‚Äôs impossible to be 100% sure who will become the blue-chip  artist in the crypto world, but I‚Äôm thinking about building a small  portfolio by investing $10-15k in promising artists.

Is  there any analytics like Artnet or Art Market monitor available for  NFTs? So far, I've checked out some works on the secondary market and it  seems that everyone is trying to just quickly make 10X, YOLO style.

Another question - does it make sense to buy NFTs now, amid the recent crypto price drop?

&amp;#x200B;

You can:

\- submit a proof and upload it to IPFS, then register it on Ethereum, Ropsten testnet.

\- view submissions on a map.

\- click on a placemark -&gt; click on the link to view individual submissions.

\- support a submission by clicking on ""click to support"" at the bottom of the page -&gt; pay Ropsten ETH.

&amp;#x200B;

**! IPFS files disappear eventually if they are not pinned by nodes, or you can witness very slow loading times.** 

&amp;#x200B;

# What can you do?

\- run an IPFS node and host &amp; pin the files - the ""marks"" (markdown dApps) themselves first and then individual submissions.

\- suggest better ways to provide persistence to files on IPFS

\- invite IPFS node maintainers and security auditors to help the whistleblowers.

\- volunteer to help development - e.g. Twitter bot that tweets new submissions or donations.

&amp;#x200B;

# Decentralized System Management

This is not only a whistleblower dApp. It is an engine for creating dApps from Markdown and publishing them on IPFS. You can extend the whistleblowers system yourself even now, by following the tutorial from the menu.

&amp;#x200B;

# Open Source

The code will become open source as soon as we have the first outside volunteer and, in any case, before any Mainnet release.

# Demo Time

Video demo: Whistleblowers dApp - Map of Submissions

[https://youtu.be/lRTxO3gKvFk](https://youtu.be/lRTxO3gKvFk)

In the last video, I showed how a whistleblower can load a submission on IPFS and register it in a contract deployed on Ropsten. The submission is tagged with space and time markers, along with other tags. So, by looking at the contract events, we can decode the data and show the submissions on the map.",1622544381,lorecirstea,True,1,9,2021-06-01

ethereum,How etherum saved my life.,"So I‚Äôve been having struggles with money for all my life . Been strictly with one bank and used it ever since I was born. I recently started to branch out saving because they didn‚Äôt have any interest rates on my savings account . 

Along the way I got way into crypto. I have strong feelings about Eth, positive ones. And so I put a majority of my money in ETH. Which seemed risky at first. But I thought hey, it‚Äôs pretty good to have some money off the grid so to say. 

Well today it payed off. The bank has had problems with purchases from a month ago and it put me in the mud. I‚Äôm currently -200$ in my fiat bank and couldn‚Äôt even start thinking about paying it back. But..

I still have my etherum. That they couldn‚Äôt touch because of errors on their side. And that etherum is the one thing that‚Äôs paying for everything right now. Food, housing , the whole deal. 
I don‚Äôt know why more people don‚Äôt believe in crypto, but when I get my salary at the end of this month I think it‚Äôs time to invest more into this. It just seems logical. (After clearing my debt ofc) 

Just thought I‚Äôd share my positive experience with ETH. :)",1622538031,Mercy_artz1,True,1,84,2021-06-01

ethereum,Knight of the Dip,"
It was May 23rd and I'd fallen asleep ignoring notifications chiming in from half a dozen phone apps until I couldn't ignore them anymore. My eyes were still adjusting to the phone's light when I began scrolling, and I assumed an executive order had just come down banning Bitcoin. The price action certainly reflected it. My portfolio had lost a staggering amount and my girlfriend was calling me:

""What's going on?"" she frantically said, ""It won't stop!""

I didn't say anything because I was busy looking for the catalyst. But all I found was China FUD certain I'd missed something.

""Hello!"" she screamed.

""I'll call you back in five minutes."" I needed to buy the dip.

""But‚Äî""

I hung up and stared into the wall. The radio silence of friends was telling. Clearly they were already ahead of me. I'd actually practiced and prepared for this very emergency. As an OG, I do keep funds on a CEX (CoinBase in this case) all in USDC stablecoins ready for marching orders as circumstances demand. I never use CoinBase by the way, except for idling these interest-earning stablecoin troops for deployment. The battle wouldn't last long though, and I was having trouble using my phone with such shaky hands. Already four different apps were notifying me Bitcoin was bleeding at $30k and its bellwether brother Ether had been cut-down below $2k. A massacre of bloody red ink. This is where my combat training paid-off. The buy and liquidation list went as follows:

Buy:

 - ZED.RUN Horses
 - Polygon (MATIC)
 - Uniswap
 - Ether
 - Maker

Liquidate:

 - GOVI
 - All small protective options positions

This was going to take time. Probably 45 minutes or so, ultimately costing $1k in gas fees. Didn't matter, the Chinese had reached our shores and were about to kick down my damn door. My girlfriend tried calling again so I blocked her, temporarily‚Äîthere was no time to waste. 

My laptop showed 80% when I tore it from its wall-charger and clicked the MetaMask icon walking to the adjacent living room. The coffee table, littered with take-out boxes served as my desk. My apartment is too small for a worthwhile desk or one of those glass table's for two. I pushed everything to the ground to make way for Mac. And it's funny, because just then I heard commotion in the unit above me, and I couldn't help but wonder if my neighbors up there were looking through their blinds for the Chinese too. Anyway, crypto kept falling. A Twitter message popped up from a YouTube shill I follow that said: 

*Alt season is over.*

For celebrity shitcoins I certainly hope so. I considered pausing everything just to unfollow him. 

So I was able to liquidate GOVI. This was the most important thing. GOVI is the governance token for the CVI (crypto volatility index) by the way. And my god had it soared. Crypto volatility was at 175 (and would later peak at 190). For reference, 2018 and the March 2020 Covid dip peaked volatility around 170. It's no secret those two times correlated with extraordinary buying opportunities. So it's easy to imagine how important a dip like this was to get. The GOVI I swapped for big swingin' dick Ether and I wouldn't touch it. Then it was on to Sparrow and I closed the OTM covered calls which were now trading near intrinsic value. Crypto's crash was accelerating though, and I switched back to my phone. CoinBase took forever to load, and when it did, it might as well of returned a 404. Screwed. I couldn't buy anything. The desktop site was no help either. I couldn't even send the stablecoin troops to MetaMask. Back on the computer I connected to Opensea (an NFT marketplace) to check the prices of ZED.RUN horses. I found some from a great race class, my eyes locking on a teal colored one named Sudden Insight. This stallion was $5000 only 48 hours gone by, now $2200 based on my quick ETH calculation. But CoinBase was still down and there wasn't anything I could do but watch MATIC bottom at .76, UNI rebound off its 200 dma and MKR say enough is enough. Unbelievable. I called my friend Mike but his phone went to voicemail after two rings. A search of Twitter found everyone had the same CoinBase problem with some OG having the definitive say:

*This is why you don't keep money on centralized exchanges.*

No shit you rich bastard‚Äîwhich I suppose made my transgression hell-worthy. Then came pounding on my front door. 

Kristin was standing on the other side with the attitude of an owner who's dog I'd just kicked.

""The fuck!""

She had no makeup on and just biked ten blocks. I didn't say anything and motioned her inside, hoping the exaggerated look of horror on my face was enough to appease her anger. I'm the one that got her in to this. She was content working a 9-5 marketing job that paid $20/hr before I expanded her mind with the promises of DeFi, NFT's, Web 3.0 and ERC20 hegemony. She put in all $10k of her savings (ETH, BTC, YFI, respectively) and since last August, all had been bliss. Now she was just above break-even. She couldn't buy the dip. 

""I know, Kristen relax.""

This was her first selloff. Must've been traumatic. I remember my first in 2018. It was the end of the world. Through all this one thing was certain: I'd never use a CEX ever again‚Äîsave for conversion to fiat. I led her to the couch where she sat disoriented and I explained in a white-hot heat what was about to happen:

Volatility is too high, it won't stay here long, and all the 2x-10x leverage is being liquidated (I spun the computer around to show her some activity on DeFi), the futures premium is at a six month low and contracts about to be in backwardation, options sellers/buyers will rebalance to safe positions, all the weak hands will be shaken from the market, but the greed won't, those who haven't sold through this, never will. The crypto fear index should register an all-time high and by next week you'll see a historic amount of fiat and stablecoins on exchanges (DEX and CEX) waiting for an excuse to bring a tidal wave of money back in. At worst we endure a crypto winter until July accumulating in the process. Selling here and walking away would be the biggest mistake of your life. I'm here with you. God I felt like those cheap crypto cartoons on YouTube and hated myself. Until CoinBase went live again and I stopped the Gettysburg Address to finally going to work. 

Later that night she took me deep enough that her lips felt the sandpaper of my recent shave. And here we are.",1622516848,Shatter_Hand,True,1,9,2021-06-01

ethereum,Question about uniqueness of keys/addresses in different derivation paths,"I've been trying for the past few weeks to recover some ethereum that I forgot I had. It's a pretty significant amount (5 figures USD). Trouble is I only know the addresses right now. I don't remember what wallet/service they were associated with. I do have a bunch of mnemonic recovery phrases for various coins (most of which are poorly labeled or not labeled at all because I am great at keeping records, obviously).

Recently I was using Ian Coleman's Bip39 tool to check some recovery seed phrases with various derivation paths, and for a second I thought I had found one of the relevant addresses/Private keys, but it turned out to just be a close match. For example if my target address started with  0x12345abXXXXXXX... the address I found was 0x12345baXXXXXXX (XXX characters are where the similarities end)

So my question is, is that just bad luck/crazy coincidence? Or could it be that addresses generated by the same seed can be similar to others at different derivation paths for some mathematical reason I don't understand? Also, if the answer is the former, what is the probability of that happening (roughly)?

I have tried researching this but haven't been able to find any info related to this specific type of thing (none that I have been able to understand or recognize, at least).

If anyone here can shed some light on this for me I would very much appreciate it.

1) Is anyone following the core team discussions and knows how confident people are that PoS can fully replace PoW? Is it just a question of ""when"", or is there still some ""if"" / ""how"" left?

2) What are the most feared/realistic risks ‚Äî¬†e.g., pre-merge angry miner 51% attacks, validator collusion (MEV), long-term centralization of power, trust in volatile token collateral vs. ""tangible"" energy cost, etc.?

3) What would a rollback look like if the switch was flipped too early? Is there a full rollback scenario?

We are Nick and Chris, two long-term ETH HODLers and software developers who want to help build useful DeFi DApps. That's why we created [https://diffex.io](https://diffex.io), a smart contract DApp that allows you to write, sell, buy, and execute options contracts for ERC20 tokens. Currently, we have launched a beta version of the Dapp on the Ropsten testnet that you can try without using any real ETH or ERC20 tokens. For this beta version, we created a free ERC20 token called DFTX (DiffEx Test) that can be used as the underlying asset for calls and puts. To get some, join our discord server: [https://discord.gg/fZksGrs89W](https://discord.gg/fZksGrs89W) or telegram: [https://t.me/diffexio](https://t.me/diffexio).

ethereum,üòâExchange your loyalty points to points of another shop on DragonBite. You will never lose your loyalty points with DragonBiteüí≤!,"Dragonbite - Turn your idle reward points into cryptocurrency 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone knows that loyalty programs help attract more customers to the store that is why they are so popular. They help to shop to increase its revenue. At the same time, loyalty programs are profitable to customers, as they help to significantly save money.

&amp;#x200B;

All stores have their own loyalty programs, there is no unified system of loyalty programs, different stores are not interconnected. It is impossible to send the unused points to other users inside the loyalty program of one shop. 

&amp;#x200B;

Customers often do not have enough accumulated points to buy the necessary goods. They can't buy missing points or sell extra points. All received points are often lost, because they burn up over time and the person does not have time to use them or acommulate them. 

&amp;#x200B;

DragonBite was created to solve all these problems. DragonBite is a platform that allows people to combine, store and swap loyalty programs on one platform. You will never lose your accumulated points under the loyalty program of a particular store.

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't need the points you have, you can sell them. If you need more points to pay for the product you are interested in, you can buy points from those who have extra ones or exchange them for points from another shop. You will never lose your loyalty points with DragonBite.

&amp;#x200B;

DragonBite is a truly open, decentralized asset management platform for loyalty programs of various stores in one app with one password!

&amp;#x200B;

DragonBite's vision is to disrupt the loyalty market with innovative business models and technologies. You will no longer lose your points. Thanks to DragonBite it became possible to buy, sell and exchange loyalty points.

&amp;#x200B;

‚úÖ Since 2018  DragonBite has been working on a Loyalty program.

‚úÖ Around 50,000 merchants  have joined the platform.

‚úÖ 1M people use the platform.

&amp;#x200B;

A huge user base and a large number of partner stores allow us to unite the most profitable loyalty programs in one place and provide our users the best conditions, significantly reducing their costs. With our experience and user and merchant customer base, we are ready to solve all problems of loyalty programs!

&amp;#x200B;

üëâ Our advantages

&amp;#x200B;

‚úÖ  A Digital wallet in one app with one password.

It is a fully integrated and decentralised financial services system, which is designed for digital assets management.

&amp;#x200B;

‚úÖ   Loyalty worth a fortune. 

&amp;#x200B;

90% of companies have some sort of loyalty [programs.In](https://programs.In) fact, the redemption rate of loyalty programs is just 7%, most people do not know the value of their loyalty points. Users of the platform will be able to spend their unused points to pre-pay DragonBite cards for daily consumption in real life. Customers can spend their expiring points to buy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

‚úÖ Turn your loyalty points into cryptocurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

It is compliant with compliance rules such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &amp; the Personal Data Privacy Ordinance (PDPO), the Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) standard and the Know-Your-Client (KYC) standard. 

&amp;#x200B;

‚úÖ DragonBite is technology advances!

&amp;#x200B;

DragonBite is directly connected with Crypto Exchange via a licensed payment gateway. It is powered by a hybrid IT architecture, that is partly on-chain and partly off-blockchain. BITE Point is our universal loyalty token, acting as a medium of exchange among digital assets. It is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. DragonBite will deploy Non-Fungible Token (NFT) to handle rare assets.

&amp;#x200B;

‚úÖ Travel even more with DragonBite!

&amp;#x200B;

This currency is molding into a sports niche. From what it looks like, this coin is striving to dominate the World of Sports. This is actually really interesting ü§î. Look at some of the rewards you get for using Emax to purchase Mayweather v Paul tickets. Things like a percentage off / signed boxing gloves if you spend $5000+ / etc. This reminds me of Credit Cards and how different cards give different rewards for using their cards... So... What I see is a possibility of Emax not trying to compete with the big dogs, but rather dominate as the currency to use for anything Sports. What if we eventually get other currencies to dominate other niches like travel / services / etc. What are y‚Äôall‚Äôs thoughts on this?

ethereum,"Nature and history of money, property rights, fraud and the potential of crypto: The context","Dear all,

it might be a good idea to introduce some basic concepts to the community ‚Äì especially nowadays as most people are focused on prices and short-term gains. Even though this might have been written down multiple times, I believe that it is valuable to bring it together in a unique piece of information. I decided to post this text to multiple subreddits to reach more people. A lot of people in the subreddit here do not understand basic but important concepts of money and its history ‚Äì a state of affairs that I am motivated to help change.

After reading this text it shall be clear why it belongs to these subreddits as the topic covered is of **philosophical** and **economical** nature. Crypto is way more than just asking the question ‚ÄòWhen moon?‚Äô. 

**What is money?**

Over time, gold and silver were used as money. Money is defined as a means of exchange, storage of value and a unit to calculate prices with. But how did it come that across continents, so many different cultures used these precious metals as money? Consider the natural situation where the economy is not well developed. If you want to exchange something, you need to use barter which is inefficient and time consuming. The detection of a good usable as money is crucial to benefit society as it allows participants to use their most sacred resource ‚Äì their lifetime ‚Äì to pursue other things with the time saved from barter exchange. But how does a good become money? There is one common evolution that can be observed and logically explained ‚Äì Ludwig Edler von Mises termed it the **‚ÄòRegression Theory of Money‚Äô** in his habilitation ‚ÄòTheorie des Geldes und der Umlaufmittel‚Äô (in English ‚ÄòThe Theory of Money and Credit‚Äô) from 1912. This theorem states that money has value as of now because it had value yesterday; put into context nowadays, one might say that this is the network effect. But if you ‚Äòregress‚Äô this back in time, there has to be a starting point: **The first time a good becomes money is the transition of a valuable product into a mean of exchange, and this mean should be commonly accepted across market participants.** Gold and silver were valued as jewellery, so many people in a barter economy would be fine with accepting this. The transition of this value into a mean of exchange leads to a network effect were the good gets a **monetary value** as well, a so called **Tauschwert**. This is remarkable, as people who don‚Äôt valued jewellery at all would start accepting this because of its **Tauschwert**. The same could be observed after World War II in Germany, were American cigarettes became a mean of exchange in the destroyed German economy. Even non-smokers accepted it after it had gotten a **Tauschwert**. Besides, there are exotic examples of monetary goods, such as the so-called ‚ÄòRai stones‚Äô in Micronesia that were small to very large round stones with a circle hole in the middle and not easily transportable but used as money. This is a nice example that a common belief can result in the emergence of money; but does the Micronesia example contradict Mises‚Äô theorem? Not necessarily, as value is subjective and a very strong (also religious) belief might as well provide value in itself. Nevertheless, the more ‚Äòclassic‚Äô transition of a valuable product resulting in money was clearly the norm.

But this is not enough. Money should also be hard to fake, it should ideally be dividable in smaller units and it should definitely be long lasting. All these reasons spoke for precious metals like gold and silver. In a nutshell, the fact that they are hard to fake and that their supply is not increasing ambiguously make them ideal money. Why is a solid and slow increasing supply important? If you aim at storing value in time, this characteristic follows from basic economic thinking of supply/demand. The demand is quite stable and will be increasing over time if societies and economies get more efficient. Trust in the fact that the gold or silver supply will not just double in two years make it ideal to store value over time. So, as people can‚Äôt be trusted easily, precious metals scarcity and their difficulty to counterfeit made them ideal for people to trade without trusting some specific entity. Unfortunately, there was one problem: States/ empires could monopolize the minting and this is what usually happened. The nominal value of a coin could be the same but the amount of precious metal inside could be reduced in order to mint more coins. The first quantitative easing was born! With these methods, empires could finance their expensive wars. The Roman Empire wars are a perfect example of this process. 

As things went on, gold smiths (the first banks so to speak) started to accept gold, promised to deposit it in exchange for a paper certificate verifying the amount of gold; whoever claimed that certificate at the proto-bank was able to get the physical gold. This is where the ‚Äòtrust-layer‚Äô comes in. Gold in itself is trust-less, one ounce of gold is one ounce of gold, period. But as human technology evolved over time making life more comfortable and easier, the need for convenient means of exchange representing money (the gold in deposits) like paper became clear. But you might guess the potential misuse of such a system. By issuing more certificates than what could be backed by gold, some proto-banks discovered the Cantillon effect / seigniorage: Whoever would make use of its newly created certificates first could accumulate wealth, while subsequent users would be faced with a decrease of the monetary value of their certificates. Indeed, after the new certificates find their way through the economy and aren‚Äôt hoarded somewhere, prices tend to go up, a phenomenon commonly referred to as ‚Äòinflation‚Äô. Without going too much into detail, this process is not proportional by the amount of newly created certificates but generally in the long term, an effect on prices will occur. One could interpret this wealth transfer under the lens of the fundamental laws of thermodynamics (first and second law), which states (in very simplistic terms) that ‚Äònothing is for free‚Äô, no perpetuum mobile is possible. The very same scientific truth applied to the economy: Nothing is for free, someone always has to pay for it.

To speak it out clearly: This process is fraud and it is **not** compatible with property rights. By breaking the promise of gold depositing the bad actor clearly violates the underlying contract: most people would not voluntarily accept an ambiguously inflating certificate scheme. Also, it dilutes the purchasing power of old certificate holders. In a free-market system, these bad actors should get punished and be treated as criminals by the judicial system in place. But states/ empires began to monopolize and/or regulate the system and this is where the real drama begins. As states/ empires are **monopolies of force** with limited control mechanisms on how this force was and is used, it is clear that this institution has an interest in extracting purchasing power from the peasants (also called ‚Äòtaxpayer‚Äô nowadays). Across history, war financing was the main incentive to expand the power even further. Nowadays, it is still war financing but also social welfare programmes, as the former also require large amounts of money (just check the government spending of the USA and you will be surprised by the fact that way more is spent on social programmes than on military even though the defence budget of the USA is more than insane).

**Free markets and capitalism are incompatible with fiat money**

 As already stated, the dilution of purchasing power is fraud and incompatible with property rights. Of course, you might be free to found a bank that is issuing more certificates than gold deposits and tell your customers about this procedure from the very beginning orally and also via contracts. However, with other actors competing for this market this is not likely to be a sustainable business model. Why should anyone put his or her hard-earned money into such a bank?

This is why in today‚Äôs world, we do certainly **not** live in free markets as a lot of people think. We have elements of free markets for sure, certainly this is true and certainly comes in various flavours (take Australia for example and compare it to North Korea). But currently **all** states in the world have a fiat-money regime. Money in itself could be classified as an own type of good, neither consumption, nor production good. One might conclude that it constitutes a class of its own, a class of good that is so important that it represents one side of a trade for almost all trades in an economy. Free markets and capitalism **require** property rights as this is the very definition of it; if the means of production (land, labour, properties, machinery and so on) are private you have capitalism, period. Even the degree of ‚Äòprivate property‚Äô is controversial as the government owns large amounts of land; the government regulates a lot, so even if you are a private owner on paper, a state can regulate so much that it is de facto also an owner of your property (simply put, this is the model of fascism; instead of ‚Äòcollectivizing the means of production‚Äô, the government can ‚Äòcollectivize the individual‚Äô); your labour is taxed by the government and depending on where you live by quite a substantial amount and additionally a lot of people are paid directly by the government (local or federal) because they work as public officials and so on. But most importantly: Money as it is today is issued by central banks with no backing whatsoever; therefore a **central** bank perverts the concept of **free** markets and capitalism. Even if a central bank is partly ‚Äòprivate‚Äô as the Swiss National Bank (you can actually buy stocks from this central bank), central banks are a creation of law and **not** of free markets.

**Why the US gold standard was a fraud scheme**

**What is a gold standard?** In a strict and correct term, it means that **gold is money** and every paper certificate using as means of exchange is 100% backed by it. With this perspective, the USA actually gave it up with the founding of the First Bank of America in 1791. This central bank lasted until 1811 and was able to issue debt certificates in a higher amount than what could be backed by gold. The founding of the Second Bank of America in 1816 was again against the principle of a gold standard (or better: bimetallic standard, as written in the Constitution), this institution lasted until 1836. By the way: Andrew Jackson, President of the United States, fought against the Second Bank of America and vetoed its charter in 1833. In 1913, with the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank by the Federal Reserve Act, the concept of a national central bank became permanent compared to the former ones which only had licenses granted by congress. Officially, the USA still had a gold standard, but what is the motive behind a central bank under such a standard? Correct: Undermining it**. I will come back to this point with the history of the Federal Reserve and the monetary supply during the 1920s.**

In 1933, the fraud got its first large scale mark with the decision of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Executive Order 6102 which came into effect the same year the Nazis gained power in Germany. With this Executive Order, it was forbidden for US citizens to own more than 100 USD in gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States. One ounce of gold was the equivalent of 35 USD. This means that the citizens had to bring the exceeding gold to the Federal Reserve System, there they got 35 USD in paper certificates for one ounce of gold. **This was an act of fraud and theft, because the Federal Reserve of course had the ability to increase the debt amount now as it could before, diluting paper certificate holders.**

The final act against the gold standard and its ultimate murder happened on August 15th 1971 by Richard Nixon, stating: ‚ÄòI have directed Secretary Connally to suspend **temporarily** the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets, except in amounts and conditions determined to be in the interest of monetary stability and in the best interests of the United States.‚Äô (source: [https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-nation-outlining-new-economic-policy-the-challenge-peace#axzz1UZnES7PMon](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-nation-outlining-new-economic-policy-the-challenge-peace#axzz1UZnES7PMon))

It took two world wars to get totally rid of a gold-standard; because of von Mises‚Äô regression theorem people continued accepting fiat money; most of them did not even notice the difference after US President Richard Milhous Nixon ‚Äòtemporarily‚Äô stopped the exchange of dollars to gold on August 15th 1971. Until now, this is still in effect; President Nixon probably understood the word ‚Äòtemporarily‚Äô in cosmic orders of magnitude.

**Friedrich August von Hayek and the ‚ÄòDenationalisation of Money‚Äô**

Von Mises‚Äô student Friedrich August von Hayek, the real opponent of John Maynard Keynes (and not Milton Friedman as commonly thought) proposed the ‚ÄòDenationalisation of Money‚Äô published in 1976. This is a truly important work and it was published during the stagflation times in the USA (high price inflation rates, low economy growth and higher unemployment). Hayek understood one basic fact about gold standards: Even though gold is great in itself, the trust-layer with the government is flawed by design. **He proposed a free market for money to take away the power from the government.**

Do you want to know what kind of suffering has been imposed upon millions of people via fiat money? First: wars. The logic is relatively simple, you can‚Äôt finance large scale wars for a long time without fiat money; actually, the European nations abandoned the gold standard right at the outbreak of World War I (World War II was also financed by fiat money). Second, fiat money has been an instrument to steal people‚Äôs purchasing power with inflation. In its most extreme version, hyperinflation, the purchasing power has even been reduced to null. Inflating of the money supply has caused booms and busts (Mises‚Äô and Hayek‚Äôs works on this topic is recommendable) as it also affects real interest rates, which then affect human behaviour and so on. Why is human behaviour affected? Well, if interest rates are lower than in a free market based on sound money, short-term borrowing becomes relatively easier and consumption is rewarded higher than long-term saving and wealth creation. Also, companies might start using cheaper debt to finance themselves which changes their capital structure. Economic ventures become ‚Äòworth it‚Äô with lower credit cost compared to the free market case. Furthermore, states also take more debt. Thus, in a system with artificially low interest rates, monetary funds, resources and human labour get allocated in a different way, usually less efficient way, than it would be in a sound money system. The day when central banks have to raise interest rates to avoid hyperinflation, the party ends: The debt costs increase and refinancing becomes more expensive. Without such a monetary system, the subprime mortgage crisis that lead to the financial crisis of 2007-2009 would have never been possible. These large risks wouldn‚Äôt have been taken by so many and actually, without huge additional money from the central banks and the business banks it would simply not be possible to drive a speculative frenzy of such epic proportions ruining a whole economy. There is more to this but this goes far beyond of the scope of a reddit post. The business banks‚Äô contribution to the increase of money supply happens through the fractional reserve banking regime. What is fractional reserve banking you might ask? It means that business bank can lend more money than it has in deposits which is decided by the central bank. For example, if you have your deposits at a bank, you officially lend this money to the bank which in turn lends it to others; but by doing so, the business bank creates new virtual money, as the bank must not hold 100 % fiat reserves for all the claims; that is why bank-runs ruin banks, as they do not have enough funds to cover all claims if large amounts of customers want cash; maybe this makes you understand why central banks and governments are interested in introducing their own digital currencies, a real dystopic nightmare.

So, it is now clear that a free market for money would lead to more peace, more stable economies with lower, but steadier and more sustainable economic growth. And this is why private banking with solid money like gold and/ or silver is better than the current status quo. Hayek wanted government completely out of this; and that is for good reasons in regard to history and human nature. As already mentioned, even during the gold standard times in the USA, it was possible to issue more paper certificates than gold. The Federal Reserve actually did this during the roaring twenties, contributing to the frenzy during these times which lead to a catastrophe. Murray Newton Rothbard highlights this process in his work ‚ÄòAmerica‚Äôs Great Depression‚Äô from 1963. Rothbard was a student of Ludwig Edler von Mises and wrote besides economics also about financial history with focus on the USA. He teaches us that the Federal Reserve total Dollar claims on June 1921 were 44.7 billion USD with a total gold reserve of 2.6 billion USD. Then, on June 1929, the claimed Dollar amount rose to 71.8 billion USD, a **60.6% increase** while the gold reserves rose only to 3.0 billion USD, an **increase of 15.4%** (Table 2 on page 94, can freely be accessed via [https://cdn.mises.org/Americas%20Great%20Depression\_3.pdf](https://cdn.mises.org/Americas%20Great%20Depression_3.pdf); original source is \*\*Banking and Monetary Statistics (Washington, D.C.: Federal Reserve System, 1943), pp. 544‚Äì45, 409, and 346‚Äì48\*\*).

But there still is a problem: Even with a free market monetary system with a solid gold currency the trust-layer is still existent. At least it is not monopolized with the central bank and a cartel of business banks, but market participants still have to trust the depositing institution which usually is a bank, or used to be a bank as gold has been completely demonetized. 

**The invention of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies**

This is where crypto comes in. I apologize for this long history travel, but it is important to understand cryptocurrencies‚Äô significance. **With the invention of Bitcoin it was - for the first time in human history - possible to mimic gold and remove the trust-layer.** This is not an understatement.

Let this sink in. If you understand the motivation for sound money and the incompatibility of fiat money with property rights, its pivotal role in free markets and peace, then it becomes clear that Bitcoin is revolutionary. But you may wonder, how is it possible that even people supporting sound money, Peter Schiff being a prominent example, disagree with the concept of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin? There might be multiple reasons to this, but one common argument is that it has no ‚Äòinherent‚Äô value. **However, by applying von Mises‚Äô regression theorem, one can definitely conclude why Bitcoin has value:** First, we went from barter to primitive money until many cultures and societies discovered gold and silver which were widely used throughout history. Then governments introduced a purely fiat system; what gave fiat its value? It was not the government just stating ‚ÄòHere, accept it now!‚Äô, but a long-lasting connection to gold (even though not perfect, but still) the collective used Dollar certificates and other certificates in other countries for generations. It took two world wars to get to the current fiat regime: The change was quiet and did not really appear in people‚Äôs daily life until price inflation hit. Thus, the ‚Äòregression‚Äô went from gold, to gold certificates, to fiat. With fiat being flawed by design, Bitcoin was proposed to counter the problems that come with the trust-layer. This should certainly create a value for buyers, especially in countries where you see the purchasing power being molten. The historical perspective helps us understand why for Bitcoin and/ or other cryptocurrencies to be successful, a strong network effect is a prerequisite. Then the ‚Äòregression‚Äô pattern moves towards cryptocurrencies. This is commonly  named adoption. Which cryptocurrency or cryptocurrencies will succeed? Will it be Bitcoin? Ethereum? Another crypto? A mix of cryptos? Who knows? I certainly don‚Äôt; this decision has not been made by the market participants yet, as we are still in the early days. **So von Mises‚Äô regression theorem tells us that the transition from a valuable good or a solid ground belief from the very beginning already happened and then regressed through time!**

Let‚Äôs note now that cryptocurrencies are also very powerful because governments will not be able to stop or control them. It is impossible to control every single machine connected to the internet. Even though we have nation states, at least we don‚Äôt have a world state with a world government; if one nation state decides to ban this technology - a ban that is already hard to enforce by itself - there will be incentives for other nation states to be even friendlier. A coordinated world-wide nation state attempt to destroy cryptocurrencies is practically impossible and even if, people will probably rise up as they understand that something has to be wrong.

This gives me hope. It is sad to see how governments and big corporations in bed with governments control people more and more and how the financial system gets sicker and sicker. Well, at least we do not have large scale totalitarianism as in the 20th century. But we witness the developments of more controls, more economic interventions, more money destruction through supply increase and this might lead us to more totalitarian states. But crypto is here to stay and evolve. And it is powerful. It is powerful because it is a means of disempowering nation states and the fiat money system. **Without fiat money, it is impossible to sustain and finance large states spending huge amounts of money in a way where the people making decisions did not earn the money by themselves**. It is especially impossible to finance large scale wars, a property that should by itself defeat the fiat money regime. The fiat regime is the core of statism and totalitarianism - without its core element, it can‚Äôt survive. Of course, disinformation is a crucial part of this, but it is not the core of statism and totalitarianism: Without fiat money but with disinformation, these political forces cannot achieve much. This an important to point understand, as modern large-scale wars and welfare states are impossible to finance with solid money. This is why you can‚Äôt logically promote Bitcoin or another serious crypto while being a collectivist, either a socialist or fascist. These ideologies are highly flawed in a practical and ethical sense; the argumentation about this statement (more from the practical side) has been done by Ludwig Edler von Mises himself in his masterpiece ‚ÄòSozialismus: Eine √∂konomische und soziologische Analyse‚Äô (English: ‚ÄòSocialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis‚Äô) from 1922. One of his main points is that under collectivized economies, the central planners can‚Äôt calculate on prices as there is no pricing mechanism telling participants what is worth pursue and what isn‚Äôt. Indeed, with means of production that are not private, it makes rational decisions about pricing impossible because these very same means of productions have no price. Friedrich August von Hayek wrote a lot about the impossibility of collective economies, focusing on the information problem and the inherent decentralized dynamics of the market mechanism. But there are even more arguments against it, here is a simple one: Centralization of power in order to fulfill collective economies, be it on a local level with communities or on a large level across nation states, will always corrupt people, and notably more so in the latter case, as human nature is as it is (humans want the outputs without putting in the work and the energy). There would be no problem with socialistic/ communistic or fascist communities if they respected property rights of others, but they don‚Äôt by definition. This is the moral difference between collectivism and individualism: Under an individualistic, property rights centered order, you can try whatever you want unless you don‚Äôt violate the property rights of others. In this setup, would you want to start a collectivist paradise by yourself and find people who want to voluntarily join you, you are free to do this. Ironically, starting a business and/ or using sound money under a collectivist order would possibly result in penalties and in your death in the worst case. Interesting fact: Even when done voluntarily, collectivist models fail. This can be exemplified with the New Harmony project in Indiana (USA) during the 19th century or even the Kibbutzim in Israel, many of which failed and of the remaining ones, the large majority threw their hard-core collectivist ideals away. It is also interesting that internet devices and smart phones found their way to Kibbutzim nowadays. It should not be explained that under a total collectivized global economic regime, hard work and innovation leading to our daily life‚Äôs devices wouldn‚Äôt be possible, just by the nature of human incentives and behaviour.

**Smart contracts and beyond**

Even though Bitcoin started as being a ‚ÄòPeer-to-Peer Electronic Cash-System‚Äô and now seems to find its role as a store of value (with a lot of speculative elements as it is still early), the idea of smart contracts provides even more power to decentralization by allowing to participate in businesses and trades without the trust-layer. This is achievable by Decentralized-Finance or Non-Fungible-Tokens which could become a standard for property exchange. They could one day register governance via a hard-encoded trust-less protocol on a blockchain, or bond and stock exchanges that work with lower costs and higher efficiency without intermediaries. Way more applications could probably be enabled by a such a decentralized, trust-ensuring protocol. All of this is unstoppable and will transform the world for the better. I am so happy and proud that it all started with Bitcoin, with all its ups and downs and insane stories. The sector keeps evolving, attracting more and more visionaries and great minds contributing their part to this field.

Furthermore, the impact of these technologies on governance can be truly disruptive, allowing more transparency in public finances to prevent corruption when dealing with public money in a city, province or even nation state. There are many issues yet to be solved from a technical and also architecture point of view (surely, it is useful to have privacy in the sense that nobody can track where the tax money is coming from, but as soon as it is on the public side ready to be spent, an immutable blockchain could be quite helpful here). The decentralisation of cryptos might even lead to political decentralisation, solving problems on the local level where they arose in the first place. Who knows where this journey will bring us?

Before finishing, it shall be mentioned that the large banking sector needs the government and vice versa. Simplistic thinking might lead some to the conclusion that one single governmental bank and the abolition of interest rates will solve all problems, but if you made it until here, you probably understand why this is utopist and flawed. Governments are dangerous and as long as centralization of power exists, special interests (especially from the banking side) will always lobby and gain privileges, period. With sound money, the very core enabling large powerful states is removed. Besides, with the use of smart contracts for governance there will hopefully be some additional pressure towards political decentralization. Always remember: Special interests will always try to collude governments and the more centralization, the easier it gets. It is no surprise that Ancient Greece with its decentralized nature with hundreds of small city states flourished so much compared to other areas of the world which marked the beginning of a historic journey until we got modern civilization which was born and carried out in Europe. Also, it doesn‚Äôt come to any surprise that many small city states nowadays allow their citizens high levels of wealth without access to natural resources. Even the decentralized nature of Switzerland, advocated by many (especially by citizens from the surrounding European Union with its centralistic tendencies) as combining the current best political system in the world, and the most advanced social and economic freedom enabled by strong property rights, doesn‚Äôt come to any surprise. By the way, the canton of Zug where you can find the so-called ‚Äòcrypto valley‚Äô is also located in Switzerland.

**Conclusion**

Cryptocurrencies are here to stay. They will transform this world. Hayek‚Äôs dream will come true, as there are no means by which governments can stop this evolution. I am convinced that Hayek would be deeply happy about the evolution of this field. The failure of fiat will be the victory of crypto. Even though gold and silver are great for monetary purposes, especially when thinking about an intelligent alien in our galaxy that would probably rather accept gold than a cryptocurrency, **it is human nature and thus the trust-layer that make a monetary system prone to corruption, legal action and intervention by the government possible. This messes up things even more than single bad actors in the market in the long run.** This is why gold and silver, being valued not only for jewellery, but also electronics and industry nowadays will probably always be valuable and a good hedge against price inflation in the long term. Their physical properties (noteworthy that silver is the element with the highest electrical and heat conductivity which make it unique) give them their own strengths and powers.

I believe that it is too early to say which cryptocurrency or cryptocurrencies will make it; let us see. Maximalism is a single-minded attitude in a fast evolving and relatively new field. Only time will tell what will succeed and what won‚Äôt. But I can assure you one thing: **The idea of decentralized cryptocurrencies will succeed and make this world a better place. Hayek‚Äôs idea is more powerful than ever before and it is gaining power and popularity. The failure of fiat will be the victory of crypto.**",1622386607,UpperOrdinary,True,1,12,2021-05-30

ethereum,A currency symbol for Ethereum,"Justin Drake recently posted on Twitter about the need for a Unicode character for the ETH currency: [https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1397930556763955200](https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1397930556763955200)

I posted a suggestion in that thread for a currency symbol which seemed to garner some appreciation. Since posting that suggestion, I have been thinking a little bit more about if we could instead start from the Greek uppercase Xi character which is becoming well-established. By adding two thinner vertical lines, it can:

1. function as a unique Unicode character for the Ethereum currency,
2. be easier to identify as a currency symbol (a problematic aspect of the Xi symbol),
3. retain the already established style.

What do you think?

I think that eth not have a fixed supply makes the price centralized because at any moment they can add more supply and the price will go down hence they can ""control"" the price.

ethereum,Questions about smart contracts and why did Fizzy.axa was deemed unprofitable and shut down even if it didn't have intermediaries?,"I tried searching in Reddit and Google but there was no direct answer (or at least my search terms didn't stumbled anything in particular).

I'm finally delving into the deep knowledge of Blockchain, Smart Contracts, Cryptocurrencies and trying to understand the why, pros, and cons of the technology, and what it could potentially solve.  After making many mistakes in the past, I've decided to play, tinker, and get my hands dirty on technology before taking the plunge (as cons may surprise you down the line). 

I came across several videos that I've been watching about the AXA insurance company and how it pioneered back in 2017 the use of Smart Contracts in the Ehtereum blockchain. 

What I don't get is why would they need to use the blockchain in the first place? I mean, yes, they needed a way for customers to skip calling for the verification, but so what? Wouldn't it be easier to set up cron jobs or event systems in-house to trigger reimbursements automatically? Or was it so the user could prove that what Axa was doing was legit as everything is recorded in the blockchain?  (I mean, that would work for a small company with no traction, but Axa is a multi-billion dollar company that is listed on the stock exchange. They would get scrutinized if didn't play by the rules). 

In addition, why was it closed as they deemed it ""unprofitable"" or "" has struggled to reach commercial targets with its first Fizzy product, claiming there isn‚Äôt sufficient market appetite for a blockchain-based consumer insurance product yet ""? 

I don't get it. 

Isn't the blockchain technology transparent to the final user? I mean, you can perfectly use a traditional Web App to access the data from a blockchain and interact with it, in contrast, in VR and AR, you do need specialized equipment that is able to run specific apps. 

In addition, by 2017  the Ethereum blockchain had  25,000 nodes (According to blockgeeks and a quick Google Search), so there's no way you would have the problem of the network not being strong enough to support the distributed transactions. 

So what was the reason? Maintenance cost?  Hosting operations? What could it be?",1622232532,Siref,True,1,0,2021-05-29

ethereum,I have an idea - and can't stop thinking about it. Perhaps you could help?,"Long story short. 

A great spot has opened in my city for a coffee place. I run a software company and am busy most of the time, but have the capital to invest in the rent, machinery, stock, salaries, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I am an ETH believer and HODLER, and want to start building real cases for it. One of the most interesting concepts of ETH is for sure DAOs to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am running businesses for almost 10 years and organisations decay thanks to ego, politics and other unproductive BS. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to set up a DAO Coffee Spot. Where every member that works there is an owner, gets a cut of the sales. That way we can set up a fully autonomous coffee shop and brand. 

&amp;#x200B;

In order for me to push this forward and commit to the 5 year lease I want to have a clear understanding of the implementation and setup of the DAO. 

&amp;#x200B;

My (Big Ask) to any ETH believer and fellow DAO lover is for some help setting up the base concepts of this organisation. I am very willing to publish the whole setup and reflection for the community. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any other ideas on how to make this happen, please let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

ethereum,üòä Turn your loyalty points into cryptocurrency with DragonBite,"Dragonbite - Turn your idle reward points into cryptocurrency 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone knows that loyalty programs help attract more customers to the store that is why they are so popular. They help to shop to increase its revenue. At the same time, loyalty programs are profitable to customers, as they help to significantly save money.

&amp;#x200B;

All stores have their own loyalty programs, there is no unified system of loyalty programs, different stores are not interconnected. It is impossible to send the unused points to other users inside the loyalty program of one shop. 

&amp;#x200B;

Customers often do not have enough accumulated points to buy the necessary goods. They can't buy missing points or sell extra points. All received points are often lost, because they burn up over time and the person does not have time to use them or acommulate them. 

&amp;#x200B;

DragonBite was created to solve all these problems. DragonBite is a platform that allows people to combine, store and swap loyalty programs on one platform. You will never lose your accumulated points under the loyalty program of a particular store.

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't need the points you have, you can sell them. If you need more points to pay for the product you are interested in, you can buy points from those who have extra ones or exchange them for points from another shop. You will never lose your loyalty points with DragonBite.

&amp;#x200B;

DragonBite is a truly open, decentralized asset management platform for loyalty programs of various stores in one app with one password!

&amp;#x200B;

DragonBite's vision is to disrupt the loyalty market with innovative business models and technologies. You will no longer lose your points. Thanks to DragonBite it became possible to buy, sell and exchange loyalty points.

&amp;#x200B;

‚úÖ Since 2018  DragonBite has been working on a Loyalty program.

‚úÖ Around 50,000 merchants  have joined the platform.

‚úÖ 1M people use the platform.

&amp;#x200B;

A huge user base and a large number of partner stores allow us to unite the most profitable loyalty programs in one place and provide our users the best conditions, significantly reducing their costs. With our experience and user and merchant customer base, we are ready to solve all problems of loyalty programs!

&amp;#x200B;

üëâ Our advantages

&amp;#x200B;

‚úÖ  A Digital wallet in one app with one password.

It is a fully integrated and decentralised financial services system, which is designed for digital assets management.

&amp;#x200B;

‚úÖ   Loyalty worth a fortune. 

&amp;#x200B;

90% of companies have some sort of loyalty [programs.In](https://programs.In) fact, the redemption rate of loyalty programs is just 7%, most people do not know the value of their loyalty points. Users of the platform will be able to spend their unused points to pre-pay DragonBite cards for daily consumption in real life. Customers can spend their expiring points to buy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

‚úÖ Turn your loyalty points into cryptocurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have loyalty points expire soon or a small number of air mileage or any old in-game asset, you can convert those digital assets into Bitcoin with a very reasonable transaction fee. DragonBite wallet is directly connected with cryptocurrency exchange via a licensed gateway. It is compliant with compliance rules such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &amp; the Personal Data Privacy Ordinance (PDPO), the Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) standard and the Know-Your-Client (KYC) standard. 

&amp;#x200B;

‚úÖ DragonBite is technology advances!

&amp;#x200B;

DragonBite is directly connected with Crypto Exchange via a licensed payment gateway. It is powered by a hybrid IT architecture, that is partly on-chain and partly off-blockchain. BITE Point is our universal loyalty token, acting as a medium of exchange among digital assets. It is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. DragonBite will deploy Non-Fungible Token (NFT) to handle rare assets.

&amp;#x200B;

‚úÖ Travel even more with DragonBite!

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone has been staying at home since early 2020 and their air miles are expiring. DragonBite offers a new method to spend air miles.  With DragonBite, you will be able to convert your mileage to any other loyalty coupon,  to sell it and invest into Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

Looking for constructive opinion and discussion.

Have a few questions to start with
1) EIP1559 is expected to be around this coming July, so I‚Äôm more interested in ‚Äúwhat could go wrong?‚Äù. Any technical or reality issue that could lead the improvement to fail? What are the things that will be limiting or holding PoW to PoS back?
2) If improvement and algorithmized burnt fees are expected, shouldn‚Äôt it be lesser miners now? As the transition will cause them to only earn from getting Eth after mining (compared with the current miner fees)?
3) What if there‚Äôs a 51% attack?

ethereum,Naming rights of my cat - as NFT,"I'm thinking of a project but don't want to get too in to the specifics so here is a similar idea:

I want to sell the naming rights of my pet cat. Whoever owns the token can change the name. I'll check the token each morning to see what I need to call my cat, as its name may have changed (ideally it can only change once per ownership but this isn't a necessity). 

How can I do this? I know I could mint an NFT - but I'd want to be able to have a link so I can check the name - so there'd need to be some editability of it and only by the owner of it. Whatsmycatsnametoday.com could look it up for example and display it.

ethereum,My Retiring Father's Crypto Concerns," I'm having a discussion with my father(62) who is approaching retirement age about using crypto as a way to diversify his investments. He will have a comfortable retirement regardless of adopting cryptocurrency; but I'd like to turn him around on his stance. He understands the store of wealth concept; but doesn't think crypto works as a currency. His takes:

1. Takes notice of high transaction fees compared to standard credit
2. And experiences FUD regarding the federal government not adopting/outright banning crypto. Obviously no entity can ""take down"" crypto; but I kind of see his point that sanctions from the US government would limit its practical applications and/or value.

Background: He is a tech guy, and has always been a proponent of innovation and moving things forward while also being a highly skeptical person who hails from a small-farm in a very rural area. He helped introduce GPS precision mapping to farming in the 90's. Builds his own planes, invested in the internet pre and post bubble. Forward-thinking guy all around; but gives no time to bullshit or pipedreams. Not a dreamer if you will, very much a pragmatic realist.

What can I tell him regarding those two points? I really would like to win him over with some honest talking points. And honestly, I'm interested in learning more about those issues myself.",1622155560,Dreaducate,True,1,23,2021-05-28

ethereum,I don't understand how the gas fees work,"I am trying to transfer some of my cryptocurrency (ex. USDC) into another wallet/marketplace. I believe when I transferred from CoinBase to another wallet, CoinBase themselves paid the gas fees since I don't have ETH in my CoinBase account. The only weird thing is that the amount I transferred wasn't the entire amount and paid a network fee to CoinBase? So, if I ""had"" ETH in my CoinBase then I could pay for the gas fee myself, wouldn't it have been better for me to done the transfer using my own funds? I am assuming this how things operate in CoinBase (a fee from themselves?) or maybe someone could clarify this part for me. Perhaps I do not understand the difference between network fees and gas fees? Or are there more fees that I need to know of?   


There are some questions I have about the gas fees and how they work. First, I am using sites such as [gasnow.org](https://gasnow.org), [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io), and [ethgasstation.info](https://ethgasstation.info/). When using these sites and trying to figure out the ""best"" pricing to choose from, I wonder if it's reliable on setting these custom prices compared to using whatever the wallet/marketplace price gives you. The next thing I am confused about is the Gas Limit part. Gas Limit 21,000 seems to be the minimum amount. I am not sure if I should use this amount since I've read that it's only for simple transactions though I don't know what a ""simple transaction"" is. When transferring a stablecoin such as USDC, is that considered a ""simple transaction"" or would it fall under a ""smart contract""? If so, how do I differentiate transactions that are ""simple"" and using ""smart contracts""? I believe transactions using smart contracts require more fees, thus using the minimum Gas Limit may not succeed. So, how does one determine what Gas Limit to use since I read that using too little would be rejected and using too much would be a waste but you might get refunded for the extra portion of Gas not used? I see that [gasnow.org](https://gasnow.org) lists the amount of ""gas used"" under the transaction costs though it brings me back to the same question on how reliable it is to custom set the Gas Limit.  


If there are additional resources/better tools to use for these gas fees transactions, it'll be nice to know. These are the current ones I've stumbled upon and I don't mean to be doubtful/bashful on these platforms that are providing good data. I am just a newbie in the crypto space living in the shittest state that doesn't want to deal with crypto making certain exchanges/platforms unaccessible. I am trying to read more before making any big moves/transactions so that I don't get screwed with mismanaging my wallets. Thanks for taking the time to deal with my nonsense.",1622154038,HoGayLo,True,1,12,2021-05-28

Anyone from outside who also wants a coin should reasonably also pay money from the outside world equal to what it took to make that coin (there is no incentive to sell for less). So everyone with coin is slightly richer.

In the case of proof of stake, for them to make more coin, they don't have to invest anything. It takes nothing extra for them to stake their coin. Now there is more coin and no extra value. Anyone from outside who also wants a coin can reasonably pay them less, since the cost is not tied to anything of value in the real world. So everyone  with coin is slightly poorer.

A couple of friends and I are working on an app that will let users mint their own Instagram posts as NFT's so that they can offer it to their followers. We're still a couple of weeks away from releasing it but the thinking is that content creators or artists could have a way to monetise their creations. Perhaps in a way it could be a way for up &amp; coming influencers to create value too - an early post on Instagram might be worth little for someone unknown but would be higher-priced if they become popular, so almost like their own 'shares'.

I was wondering what everyone thought about this. If you're a content creators, would you mint your Insta posts? If you're a follower, would you actually buy an NFT of an Insta post?",1622120264,kimdotninja,True,1,9,2021-05-27

I'm trying to wrap my head around the concept of smart contracts. I see that it's a self-executing contract when certain conditions are satisfied. But how can the satisfaction of such conditions are trusted and properly enforced? For example, a casino is supposed to pay out when the buyer wins. It is the casino that decides whether the buyer wins. Can the casino be trusted to honour the (smart) contract? How is trust/consensus established? If the buyer is expected to trust the casino to honour the contract, then why bother with blockchains at all?",1622088692,goppox,True,1,14,2021-05-27

There are other blockchain projects with great developers and promise, but this almost logically requires ETH to fail and claim less market cap. Been intrigued by things like HBAR or ONE but investing in those seem counter to my ETH holdings.

I'm very new the ethereum so please forgive me if this is a very beginner level question.

ethereum,Questions about ERC,"Hello, I have been actively studying the ethereum blockchain for a while and I keep getting ahead of myself with all the directions people can take. I see an exhaustive list on github with all the known major token standards (there seems to be like 30 differents kinds). But no matter where I search, there are a few things I can't seem to find. I wonder if someone can clear a few things up for me or maybe explain to me where my understanding is incorrect. I would also love some pointers on places to learn more about ethereum or places to learn about blockchain technology in general. Thank you!

1. I understand that these standards were made to simplify the process of a token being accepted onto an exchange so that it can be swapped with other tokens. Can you make a token with a contract that isn't based on one of these ""standards?""
2. If so, how hard would it be to get such a token on an exchange? I can't imagine an exchange would charge so much if all they had to do was code a little bit to accept your token, right?
3. I hear that smart contracts, once made, cannot be changed. But I see things like erc1067 (upgradeable) or multidimensional tokens that seem to have the ability to add more functionality for your token even after you deploy it.",1622053753,WookieChemist,True,1,4,2021-05-27

ethereum,Ethereum‚Äôs new Meta-DEX-Aggregator to save users from MEV,"We recently announced the launch of Gnosis Protocol V2 (GPv2). You can start trading today on the alpha CowSwap dapp [https://cowswap.exchange/#/](https://cowswap.exchange/#/) built on GPv2.

Gnosis Protocol V2 leverages batch auctions to provide MEV protection, plus integration with liquidity sources across DEXs, to offer traders the best prices.

Initially [defined by Phil Daian](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05234), MEV is a measure of the profit a miner (or validator, sequencer, etc.) can make through their ability to arbitrarily include, exclude, or re-order transactions within the blocks they produce.

Gnosis Protocol V2 (GPv2) is the missing DeFi component Ethereum‚Äôs infrastructure needs. It allows users to enjoy the benefits of MEV protection because it's built with three important considerations in mind. The three main characteristics (from less important to most important) that make GPv2 stand out from other protocols are:

1. Access to on-chain liquidity with strict enforcement for malicious behavior.
2. Off-chain orders via signed messages.
3. Price finding mechanisms based on batch auctions with uniform clearing prices and Coincidence of Wants (COWs).

ethereum,What is the best argument for switching from PoW to PoS?,"So I've been buying ETH for a few months now, and I really do like the technology.  I am however very concerned about the idea of switching to proof of stake.  I have done some research but as of now haven't seen any good reasoning at all other than ""it's good for the environment"".  Clearly PoS would consume less electricity, but that is totally irrelevant to the reason one would invest in Eth.  People want a dependable, secure, reliable system to protect their investment. Saving energy as an excuse to make the system objectively less secure doesn't make any sense to me.  The entire purpose of the bitcoin PoW system is that miners are investing in energy and converting that energy directly into bitcoin.  The electricity used to mine bitcoin is actually creating bitcoin and storing energy in the coin itself.  Time is money and money is store of energy + work in the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not here to shit on ETH, clearly as I am a holder myself.  I just would like to hear the best reasons for why PoW to PoS is a good idea.

So fiat currency is inherently inflationary, we print and print and devalue our currency which forces price levels to go up right. 

If we constantly force price levels up, and if cryptocurrency hits a plateu in value, wouldn‚Äôt crypo be experiencing the side effects of inflation still?

Say ‚Äúx‚Äù crypto is worth 100$ and its proved to be the stable price for it. And milk goes from 4$ a bag to 7$ a bag over ‚Äúy‚Äùtime, our crypto is worth less tommorow than it is today as long as feds keep printing money and causing price levels to rise, right?

ethereum,"Best explanation for ""What is gas?""","&amp;#x200B;

**""Gas"" is the name for a special unit used in Ethereum.** It measures how much ""work"" an action or set of actions takes to perform: for example, to calculate one [Keccak256](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/550/which-cryptographic-hash-function-does-ethereum-use) cryptographic hash it will take [30 gas each time a hash is calculated](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/params/protocol_params.go), plus a cost of 6 more gas for every 256 bits of data being hashed. **Every operation that can be performed by a transaction or contract on the Ethereum platform costs a certain number of gas**, with operations that require more computational resources costing more gas than operations that require few computational resources.

The reason gas is important is that **it helps to ensure an appropriate fee is being paid** by transactions submitted to the network. By requiring that a transaction pay for each operation it performs (or causes a contract to perform), we ensure that network doesn't become bogged down with performing a lot of intensive work that isn't valuable to anyone. This is a different strategy than the Bitcoin transaction fee, which is based only on the size in kilobytes of a transaction. Since Ethereum allows [arbitrarily complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) computer code to be run, a short length of code can actually result in a lot of computational work being done. So **it's important to measure the work done directly instead of just choosing a fee based on the length of a transaction or contract**.

So if gas is basically a transaction fee, how do you pay it? This is where it gets a little tricky. **Although gas is a unit that things can be measured in, there isn't any actual** ***token*** **for gas. That is, you can't own 1000 gas.** Instead, gas exists only inside of the Ethereum virtual machine as a count of how much work is being performed. **When it comes to actually** ***paying*** **for the gas, the transaction fee is charged as a certain number of** ***ether***, the built-in token on the Ethereum network and the token with which miners are rewarded for producing blocks.

This might seem odd at first. **Why don't operations just have a cost measured in ether directly?** The answer is that ether, like bitcoins, have a market price that can change rapidly! But the cost of computation doesn't go up or down just because the price of ether changes. So **it's helpful to separate out the price of computation from the price of the ether token**, so that the cost of an operation doesn't have to be changed every time the market moves.

The terminology here gets a little messy. Operations in the EVM have gas **cost**, but gas itself also has a gas **price** measured in terms of ether. Every transaction specifies the gas *price* it is willing to pay in ether for each unit of gas, allowing the market to decide the relationship between the price of ether and the cost of computing operations (as measured in gas). **It's the combination of the two, total gas used multiplied by gas price paid, that results in the total fee paid by a transaction**.

As tricky as it is, it's important to understand this distinction, because it results in one of the most confusing things about Ethereum transactions to the initial learner: **there is a difference between your transaction running out of gas and your transaction not having a high enough fee**. If the **gas price** I set in my transaction is too low, no one will even bother to run my transaction in the first place. It will simply not be included in the blockchain by miners. But if I provide an acceptable gas *price*, and then my transaction results in so much computational work that the combined **gas costs** go past the amount I attached as a fee, **that gas counts as ""spent""** and I don't get it back. The miner will stop processing the transaction, revert any changes it made, **but still include it in the blockchain as a ""failed transaction"", collecting the fees for it**. This may seem harsh, but when you realise that the real work for the miner was in performing the computation, you can see that they will never get those resources back either. So **it's only fair that you pay them for the work they did**, even though your badly designed transaction ran out of gas.

Providing too big of a fee is also different than providing too much ether. **If you set a very high gas price, you will end up paying lots of ether for only a few operations**, just like setting a super high transaction fee in bitcoin. You'll definitely be prioritised to the front of the line, but your money is gone. If you provided a normal gas price, however, and just **attached more ether than was needed to pay for the gas that your transaction consumed, the excess amount will be refunded back to you**. Miners only charge you for the work that they actually do. **You can think of the gas price as the hourly wage for the miner, and the gas cost as their timesheet of work performed**.

There are a lot of other subtleties to gas, but that should give you the basics! **Gas is the key mechanism that makes the complex computations in Ethereum ""safe"" for the network to work on**, because any programs that run out of control will only last as long as the money provided by the people who requested they be run. When the money stops, the miners stop working on it. And **the mistakes you make in your program will only affect the people who pay to use it**\--the rest of the network can't suffer performance issues due to your error. They will simply get a big payday when the performance issues consume all of your ether! Without this critical technique, the idea of a general-purpose blockchain would have been completely impossible.

**tl;dr:**

* Gas is the way that fees are calculated
* The fees are still paid in ether, though, which is different from gas
* The gas **cost** is the amount of work that goes into something, like the number of hours of labour, whereas the gas **price** is like the hourly wage you pay for the work to be done. The combination of the two determines your total transaction fee.
* If your gas *price* is too low, no one will process your transaction
* If your gas *price* is fine but the gas *cost* of your transaction runs ""over budget"" the transaction fails but still goes into the blockchain, and you don't get the money back for the work that the labourers did.
* **This makes sure that nothing runs forever, and that people will be careful about the code that they run. It keeps both miners and users safe from bad code!**

ethereum,"Unpopular Opinion: PoS is not more decentralized than PoW if it takes 32 ETH ($80,000) to operate a node.

I love Ethereum, I‚Äôve been building on it for years and am heavily invested. 

But this whole narrative that proof of stake will remove control from the miners and being it back to the people is absurd if in order to run a node you need to stake 32 ETH. 

Sure, a $5 Raspberry Pi is an extremely inefficient way to mine Bitcoin but at least you can participate in the network without needing to compromise your security. 

The only way to participate in PoS on Ethereum with as little as $5 would be to join a centralized pool and throw security out the window.

ethereum,"An update on Lodestar: our Typescript implementation of Eth2, and one of many official Eth2 client implementation teams!","Hi all!

Tim from [ChainSafe](https://twitter.com/chainsafeth) here! :)

We're a blockchain protocol development team working on an Eth2 client called [Lodestar](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar). Aside from building a client that will be familiar to Typescript/Javascript developers, our main focus is making light clients a reality for Eth2! Together with the other official Eth2 client teams like Prysm, Lighthouse, Nimbus, Teku, etc., we are building towards a vision of a diverse, multi-client Eth2 ecosystem!

# üéâ  Our Lodestar team actually created a [light client prototype](https://showcase.ethglobal.co/scaling/lodestar-light-client) üéâ 

for the Scaling Ethereum hackathon recently, and we will release a separate blog post detailing how light clients work, and why the Eth2 Altair hardfork enables light clients to exist in the first place! (Hint: sync committees). Coming up soon, so stay tuned!!!

# [Lodestar's recent progress, metrics, and other oddities](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/lodestars-recent-progress-metrics-and-other-oddities-49c6e646e421) üî≠

Nevertheless, we wanted to give the Eth2 community a separate update on our progress aside from light clients. We wrote about Lodestar node stabilization, how our progress with Altair-compatibility has been, how metrics are \*critical\* to our success with troubleshooting and measuring our node performance, and validator performance and profitability!

Check out the blog post [here](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/lodestars-recent-progress-metrics-and-other-oddities-49c6e646e421)!

If you're curious about Lodestar or any of our other work, we would **love** to hear from the community. If you'd like, drop us a message here, on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chainsafeth), or on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QtNsCXEA) under the #Lodestar channel!

ethereum,MEV after the switch to PoS,"I just watched the new Bankless episode on MEV  -&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVz7dOrGyY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVz7dOrGyY) (I highly recommend to subscribe to their channel. It really helps to actually understand the Ethereum ecosystem and stay up-to-date on all the new developments)

In the video the Bankless guys interview a panel of three MEV researchers about MEV and the implications of it for decentralized, trustless systems such as Ethereum. 

MEV or Maximum Extractable Value is basically all the extra value that a block proposer (either a miner under PoW or a validator under PoS) can extract from the system. Block proposers have this power because they can influence what transactions are included in the block and in what order they are included. For instance, they can ""sandwich"" (frontrun) trades, they can trigger liquidations and buy up discounted coins, and they can use many other strategies to extract (basically steal) extra value from the network and it's users. 

I think the main takeaway is that there does not seem to be a silver bullet to solving MEV, as it appears that MEV is inherent to trustless decentralized systems (you cant just make it illegal like in traditional finance). The best thing you can do is try to guide it in a way that is non-detrimental to the network and make it as transparent and accessible as possible, so everyone is aware of it and miners/validators equally share in the profits so as to avoid centralization due to information asymmetry. Basically this is the goal of these researchers with the Flashbots project. 

They also briefly discussed the effects of PoS on MEV and how the current PoS model might actually worsen the MEV problem. 

Currently under PoW block proposers are random based on the amount of hashpower they have. So a mining pool with a high percentage of the hashpower knows that it has an equally high chance of being the next block proposer. However it's still random, so they can never be sure. Therefore its very difficult to perform multi-block MEV strategies.

Under PoS block proposers are pre-selected and known at each 12 minute interval. This means that block proposers that are adjacent to each other can not only extract MEV from their own block, but can also collude to perform multi-block MEV strategies.

This has two very serious implications:

1. Multi-block MEV strategies increase the value that can extracted (stolen) from the network and it's users.
2. And even worse, it is VERY centralizing. Basically:  
Higher percentage of validators under your control -&gt; Greater chance of controlling two or more blockproposers that are adjacent to each other -&gt; More MEV that can be extracted.  
This means that centralized staking pools will not only be able to give more consistent payouts (As a solo staker the chance of proposing a block is quite small), but also higher payouts as they generate more MEV. So people will be incentivized to quit solo staking and instead join a centralized service or pool.

Single block MEV seems bad enough, but multi-block MEV could perhaps really harm some protocols. How bad would this actually be? Maybe there are mechanisms that would prevent it? Also would this centralizing effect actually play out in reality or are other existing/planned mechanisms that would counter this? Are there other ways to counter this? 

It just seems like a very important topic that deserves more attention from the community. Looking forward to your insights.",1621949546,Cheese_Viking,True,1,3,2021-05-25

ethereum,Market is heavily manipulated,"Looking at the charts of BTC, ETH, ETC, DOGE. They are exactly the same, down to 15 minutes candles. Who can time it perfectly like that? Even if alt coins all follow the same trend of BTC, they cannot go exactly the same down to minutes. If BTC 15 minute-candle goes up, all others follow, the same with down. There is only 1 explanation: market manipulation. All of them are buying/selling with bots marked to BTC chart. You can easily check that by opening binance charts. The only difference is the magnitudes. They don't go up or down with the same percentages. But they are exactly the same trend, even the magnitudes are somewhat similar. For example: if a BTC's candle goes up a lot, 10% in 15 minutes, others will have the same big up candle, maybe 8% or 12%. same as 1% or 0,5% small candles.   
This is why with heavy manipulation like this, it would be too hard to reach its real potential. First we have to figure out a way to chase out the bot traders. The best way is to ignore the hell out of it. If you buy it, just delete the app and come once every year to check if your coin is still alive.

ethereum,Ethereum == MySpace,"Ethereum has had a first-mover advantage when it comes to smart contracts and Defi. But there are already pretty clear signs that it‚Äôs a jack of all trades and it isn‚Äôt doing anything particularly well. So let‚Äôs not kid ourselves here: it‚Äôs on its way to becoming crypto‚Äôs MySpace.

- It‚Äôs ultra unsound money. Constant changes to the base protocol, some of which proved to have near-fatal bugs, make it an untrustworthy SoV. PoS increases implementation risks and will anyways make the network more centralized and thus less neutral than Bitcoin. Sure, EIP1559 will have a nice effect on pumping the price of ETH but it will still be as much an SoV as AWS credits are.
- Users don‚Äôt care about decentralization. BSC already flippening Ethereum in terms of transactions, continuing increase in traction for other more centralized chains, and the proliferation of sidechains like Polygon show that users don‚Äôt really care about decentralization on the application layer, but care more about usability/performance/low fees. Even if L2 finally makes a dent there are major caveats. Bitcoin will be the base money protocol whereas other, more centralized chains will be basically layers on top of Bitcoin‚Äôs base layer through bridges. Even protocols on top of Bitcoin like RSK/Stacks will eat into Defi. Ethereum is stuck in the middle. 
- It doesn‚Äôt have a clear vision. Retail normies have no idea what Ethereum really does and would rather go all in on dog coins. It‚Äôs a playground for web devs and early investors who can afford the stupendously high fees. Web2/Tradfi normies have lately been joining in on the altcoin casino fun.

The original is here:  [Scalability roadmap cheat sheet : ethereum (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nc27d8/scalability_roadmap_cheat_sheet/) so I won't go into details. Just two thoughts though:

\- The 640 shards is obviously unsafe right now, as Vitalik's post argues, but could be a possibility over the decade as SSD costs continue declining. Obviously, it'll happen in steps. I also feel the rollup revolution is inevitable and the most likely outcome for L1 is a subset of shards have execution enabled years down the line, after stateless/expiry, with ZK proofs, while most shards remain focused on data availability.

\- I'd like to know what a ZK-SNARKed L1 looks like! Maybe a future topic for Vitalik's blog?",1621926401,Liberosist,True,1,3,2021-05-25

ethereum,How does PoS as proposed in Eth2 promote decentralization?,"First off, I want to be clear this isn't an attack on Eth2;  how can you say higher transaction volume, speed, and efficiency is bad for Ethereum?  You can't, of course.

I've been trying to educate myself on Eth2, and I keep running into the same unanswered questions, the chief of which is articulated in the title of this post.  I've read through the Eth2 explainer on the website, and I've read [some of Vitalik's explanations.](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/06/pos2020.html)

The problem I'm running into is that these explanations make the assertion that staking will promote decentralization without robust evidence for why this would be so.  Yes, the goal of Ethereum 2.0 is to increase its scalability, security, and efficiency without sacrificing decentralization, but how is it going to accomplish that?

I know it's a nuanced question: are we talking about decentralization relative to an ASIC dominated PoW system or relative to a GPU dominated system?  

And the crux of the argument for PoS promoting decentralization seems to be that it's supposed to have a lower barrier to entry vs PoW while having a high penalty for cheating.  I'm not sold on the former (a profitable GPU mining rig is feasible at small scale and ASICs aren't that much worse); the latter is a reasonable argument, though I would point out that *destroying* the actual equipment is not necessary to penalize bad actors, even if burning their staked ether makes it significantly easier to do so in PoS.

When I think about getting into staking Ether under Ethereum 2.0, I can't help but feel some concerns about it as an individual.  If you have hundreds of Ether, staking 32 is a pretty low bar, sure.  But even today 32 Eth is over $76,000.  That's not going to encourage a lot of individuals to become full validators.  

And if you're thinking about joining a staking pool because you have less than 32 Eth, as I understand it, that requires you to trust your Eth to the pool, which means you're also trusting the pool not to break the rules and get YOUR ether burned through no fault of your own (aside from the 'fault' of choosing the wrong pool).  Defi100 is a very recent reminder of the risks of trusting in trustless systems.  If there are protections against this I would be relieved to hear about them.

So, it seems the barrier is pretty high up front for an individual looking to stake at the full 32 ETH while joining a staking pool to stake a lower amount, for the individual, may put a high percentage of your investment at risk.  If decentralization requires many small participants, my current (hopefully incomplete) understanding of staking makes me worry that it won't serve that purpose.

Another concern is accumulation and consolidation of stakes.  The incentive for stakeholders to both accumulate stockpiles of Ether and stake high percentages of their holdings will probably be pretty good for the price of Eth, but the higher the price of ETH goes, the higher the barrier for entry.  Doesn't this run the risk of promoting consolidation among stakeholders?

I appreciate any clarifications or corrections y'all can offer.  Thanks!",1621874400,Skotticus,True,1,34,2021-05-25

ethereum,What is Ether Backed by is the wrong first question," 

I'm lately seeing a lot of 'what is crypto backed by?' We get it here in this sub, but here is a short explanation that might help you guys answer this if people ask you.

For Eth, you can't understand 'what is it backed by' until you first ask the better question of 'what IS Eth?'

Eth is the ABILITY to publish any information such that:

1. Everyone in the world can see it with 0 downtime.
2. No one in the world can change it, except according to the rules you set. (ie, everyone plays by the same rules)
3. No one in the world can stop any other person or protocol from interacting with it, according to your rules.

Eth is also the ability to interact with the information anyone else has published according to the rules they have set.

Some of the information that people have used so far include ownership of collectables, tokens which denote ownership in a protocol, governing or distribution rights of businesses, exchanges of various tokens, provably fair gambling, overcollateralized loans, games, identity management, proving authenticity of news information or videos, provenance of food, low overhead insurance, prediction markets, funding new businesses, organizations that operate based on token voting, public good funding with matching funds based on number of donors rather than amounts, cross-border remittances, writing a memorial to the Chinese Coronavirus whistle-blower doctor that China couldn't remove, etc.

Humanity has only barely received this power - there will be others.

Ether is what you need to pay to interact with the Ethereum network, so ether is backed by the network itself - millions of dollars of mining equipment, billions of dollars staked, advanced cryptography, a strong and growing community, thousands of nodes around the world, bright, enthusiastic well funded engineers, etc.",1621864966,Aggravating-Ear6289,True,1,183,2021-05-24

But now that Ethereum has depreciated by more than 60% so it would probably be around $7,000.

ethereum,"A crypto noob's journey since January, 2021","Hi guys, I will start this post with some context about myself. I am a 24 year old guy from India who just completed his bachelors in computer science and engineering. I interned as a full stack developer for a few months in 2020 and managed to save about 800 USDT due to working from home. Although I got placed in this company through my university, it wasn‚Äôt exactly a great workplace. When they decided to delay converting the interns to full time employees, I took the risk and resigned, considering that I could do better and that my parents were financially secure enough and supportive for this. For the next few months I did some interview preparation and courses but job hunting wasn‚Äôt easy, especially in these difficult times. It was also very frustrating to see all my friends earning and enjoying, whereas I wasn't able to do either.

Starting this year, I decided to invest into some place that could generate me some passive revenue only for my mental peace and this is when I came across cryptocurrency. Now thanks to my education I did know a bit about blockchain but nothing about how to invest and the market. So I read a bit about it and decided to invest into bitcoin, considering it was a good long term hold given the crazy volatility of this market, and to dedicate some portion of my day to learning about how to navigate this space.

I learnt that we were in a bull run and the returns from here onward would be great and the fact that there were different crypto currencies with reasonable ideas and use cases that could be bought as investments. I learnt that historically Ethereum had been outperforming bitcoin and would be a good hold in the bull run at which point I flipped all my BTC for 0.46 ETH at \~1250 USDT. I then learnt about hedging your bets and decided to look into other coins that could prove to be good ETH competitors. Cardano was pretty low at that point  at \~ 0.4 USDT with a decent market cap, a planned roadmap and POS mode of governance. So I bought 540 Cardano with the remaining money.

Across the next few months I saw many peaks and dips and the net movement being in a positive direction where all I can say is, it was a game of patience and discipline. In this time I learnt about dollar cost averaging but since I had no more money to invest with, I could not do it. People also said that one must take profits along the way and keep some amount of liquidity to buy in case there is a big dip. This seemed pretty reasonable but I was too greedy to take profits and decided to remain all in. Although this did work out in my favor, I would not recommend this to anyone. DCA and timely profit taking is the way to go.

I also learnt more about the crypto space during this time such as what were wallets like Metamask, Yoroi, Daedalus etc. decided to transfer my ADA to my wallet and stake it. There were also pretty convincing reasons for why one should keep the bulk of the portfolio in a wallet if you plan to hold it. Through this I managed to earn 5 ADA after costs of transfer and staking fee. I even learnt a bit about yield farming through liquidity pools, things like impermanent loss etc. I have decided to make a USDC-ETH liquidity pool if we enter a bear market for a decent APY and low impermanent loss. I have picked Quickswap as a platform to do this considering their high APY and quick tokens being severely undervalued compared to the sheer volume of transactions they are handling. I also forgot to mention I also learnt about faucets and bridges in this process.

I consider myself mostly lucky here but I managed to timely liquidate my ETH at 3600 USDT Cardano at \~2.4 USDT. Why these limits? These are levels where the coins ended up consolidating during/after the big dip from $4200 ETH. I was already three times above where I had started and decided to not be greedy. A better approach as mentioned previously would be to DCA and keep taking a portion of profits on certain levels. A lot of my friends even complained about why I liquidated my ETH and at this point I feel it‚Äôs a sort of cultish reason to hold these coins through the losses in hopes of going up. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have done it, but it was already pretty obscene to have more than 3 times the money. Now that I had some stable coins, I decided to invest again if we dipped further, and boy we did. I bought 0.5 ETH at 2100 USDT and just yesterday 0.5 ETH at 1766 USDT. This enabled me to 1.0 ETH for the first time.

Not all of it is good though, when I started out, I made and lost some Ethereum flipping it for profits in daily trading. It can bring a lot of stress in one‚Äôs life and not to mention it is a pretty addictive and slippery slope. I have seen my friends become addicted to it and have sustained significant losses. Even recently I bought some Chainlink tokens thinking it is pretty low, only later to learn that alt coins will not perform as well as bitcoin in this stage of the market and on the off chance we go lower, they will fall significantly.

My current goals are to buy more and more bitcoin in this phase of the market, now that I have 1.0 ETH. Given the news on US treasury, inflation and the stock market, I want to hold more BTC even if it falls lower. So far I have bought 0.0105 BTC through DCA and have \~ 250 USDT liquid to buy the dips which my dad gave to me when I told him all this :) I have also lent the ETH and BTC I have for some marginal interest \~7% pa on my exchange compounding it after every 7 days. My portfolio today is \~3100 USDT and I feel crypto is the best investment if one considers the risks involved and exercises patience and discipline in their investment methods. I have also considered selling 30% again if we come close to $3000 levels on ETH and $42000 on BTC as it could all go downhill from there again.

On a personal note, I have also finally managed to land a job as a full stack developer at a decent company (after being rejected by over 30 shittier companies) with a vastly better salary than before and I start working next month. From a wealth management point of view, now that I will be having a steady income, I plan to diversify my investments across crypto, well performing socks, SIPs, precious metals, provident funds and fixed deposits as well as tax saving schemes such as life insurance and a bit of fiat because I feel that an early start in having a diverse portfolio would help me a long way in life.

Just thought that I would share my learnings being in the crypto space for the last five months and to everyone out there who is going through a much more difficult phase than me in life, view it as an opportunity, learn new things, discipline yourself and I am pretty sure you can do far more than this crypto noob.

Although people advise against revealing your crypto holdings, here is a picture of my portfolio, as it is still relatively small. I have no other means to prove the story mentioned above is authentic.

ethereum,A few questions about lending/LP/staking,"There is so much happening in the ethereum ecosystem that I don‚Äôt know what to do with my ETH. All these LP‚Äôs with $1B+ invested and crazy (20+% is crazy in my mind) returns seem too good to be true. 

I was wondering if anyone could help answer some questions I have and provide suggestions as to what I should do with my ETH. I don‚Äôt plan on selling any time soon, that‚Äôs for sure. 

Questions: 

1- Is lending cryptos the same as adding liquidity to a LP? Or are LP‚Äôs only for crypto pairs, and not simply, say, lending DAI or UNI?

2-  Why is it that if I go to lend DAI on Coinbase Wallet, I can get a return of 6.6% APR, but if I go on Zapper.fi, and look at the DAI/ETH pair, there is a 31.27% 1Y return?

2.5- Say on the SUSHI / ETH LP on Zapper.fi, why don‚Äôt I have to buy Sushi to provide liquidity? I tested out a DAI / ETH pool last october, and had to provide 50/50 DAI/Eth to join the pool.

3- I have a substantial amount of Eth (less than 16) currently sitting idly. Should I wait until I can stake it, or is it worth it to ‚Äúinvest‚Äù it in a moderately safe option? More generally, what will you guys prioritize between DeFi and staking?

I did this knowing full well that those cannot be moved until ETH starts trading or what not. Yes full retard. Did it while fully awake. Question is, is the staking going to start right now or at some later date? Because it said that trading of ETH 2 was not available in my region. I'm in Arizona and it's kinda hot.

*I don't wish this topic to be about mining or pricing, so I will keep it brief. I want this message to be about the security of Ethereum.*

As a miner, I noticed my profits drop some substantial 60% from the highs a few weeks ago, mainly due to the crash in current prices of Ethereum.

With EIP-1559 + current prices, mining Ethereum will become unprofitable for me and 95% of other miners out there, given that I live in an area considered to be one of the cheapest electricity in the world (Canada, at only $USD 0.8/kwh).

At current prices + EIP-1559, I think the majority of miners will likely flee the network, leaving it vulnerable to the dreaded 51% attack.

For that reason, I moved my entire Eth holdings onto Eth 2.0 staking, as I consider that to be a safer blockchain for the time being (at least until prices recover).

I think the Ethereum devs did not consider the effect on security EIP-1559 would have if it were to happen during a crash in the crypto market in general. What would the risks be if the network suddenly saw a mass exodus of miners from the network?",1621799582,Buggy3D,True,1,14,2021-05-24

ethereum,Ethereum is going to become pretty insecure at current prices + EIP-1559,"Title says it all.

Mining profits just dropped some 60% due to the recent crash, and EIP-1559 is going to cut that by another 50%...

Needless to say, mining is going to become unprofitable for 95% of miners out there unless prices go back to where they were, and I expect a mass exodus out of Ethereum mining to occur between now and then.

This leaves Ethereum vulnerable to the dreaded 51% attack.

During the highs, my 3080 was generating $12-15/day. Not too shabby.

After the crash, this has now fallen to $3-5...

If 1559 gets passed, I expect that to fall to $1-$2 per day maximum, and I live in one of the areas with the lowest electricity costs, at only $0.8 /kwh

So yes, I will stop mining Ethereum, but so will many, many miners out there.

""(c) No Guarantee of Success of Network Upgrade.¬† Coinbase makes no guarantees that the upgrade to the Ethereum network will be successful, and you understand that if the network upgrade ultimately fails, you may lose all, or a portion of, your staked ETH.¬† Coinbase will not be responsible for any ETH lost due to a network upgrade failure.""

So, what's your thoughts on staking on CB?  It sounds great considering I plan to hold my ETH a long time, but I'm on the fence on whether the 6% is worth it given the foregoing language.  Perhaps stake some and not all to minimize risk and exposure.

Thanks and good luck!

Also note that Coinbase's Help Center explains further:

""Are there risks staking ETH?¬†

Staking can be rewarding, but it also comes with the risk of loss of principal funds if the validator duties are not met. However, Coinbase will cover these risks (at no extra costs) so your principal is safe.
Coinbase cannot guarantee that the upgrade to the Ethereum network will be successful and is not responsible for any staked ETH lost due to an unsuccessful network upgrade or other factors not within our control.

ethereum,Staking: what will happen to my stake if Ethereum 2.0 were to never happen?,"I was reading the Kraken staking guide and came across this [image](https://support.kraken.com/hc/article_attachments/360094768932/Staking_ETHWarning_05062021.png) of theirs. At the bottom you'll see there's an ""Important"" warning section that states, among other things ETH and staking rewards will be locked until the Ethereum 2.0 transition is complete... this may take years **or may never occur**.

So does this mean if I were to stake now, there's a major risk in that if the 2.0 upgrade is indefinitely postponed, I would just never have access to my funds, potentially forever? That is how I'm interpreting this statement. Can someone confirm?

Personally I am a big believer in Ethereum and interested in holding it over a the next couple years at least, without any intention to sell or trade, so I am okay with volatility and price fluctuations in the meantime. I think it would be wonderful to receive some staking dividends on my investment in this period but if that potentially means I could never have access to my investment again, I feel like it's something I should reconsider.

I've been playing the market these last two months, and I'm slightly down on my overall investment. But I am holding on a ten year time horizon and will be buying more ETH (and a few other select cryptos) like clockwork every two weeks with my paycheck.

So here is the thing: I want to stake my small bag of ETH.

Binance offers locked eth2.0 staking, but they give you same amount od BETH tokens to stay in your spot.

My question is:

If I you use trade to get BETH tokens does it count like I am staking and do I get the same rewards?

(which is currently nice to trade BETH/ETH since it is 1/0.9 ratio lol, probably because of the current crazy situation, so I want to get that easy juicy extra 10% of staked ETH)

I don‚Äôt want to buy some ETH and then get stuck because I haven‚Äôt bought enough, and I don‚Äôt want to pay the equivalent to the value of the $600 USDT just to unlock it, which makes no sense right? 

I originally bought the USDT on Uphold and sent it to my Trust Wallet and now want it to go back to Uphold where gas fees are almost non existent.. So how do I do this? I have been advised that converting the USDT to something like TRX is by far cheaper option, or converting to DASH and then transferring back to my Uphold where I can convert it back to USDT to save my gas fees, but I don‚Äôt know how much ETH gas fees I will need to unlock the USDT?

First, I'm thinking of building on top of some of the layer 2's out there like polygon to take advantage of the lower fees

Second, I'm thinking of starting with a stablecoin pool to bootstrap the stablecoin side and while its not yet ready for lending out, I could always send some of the pool over to places like [curve.fi](https://curve.fi) or sushiswap so that the user's funds could earn an interest and have some use (sort of like yearn) while I build out the non-stablecoin/borrowing side 

What do you guys think of something like this? i'm trying out to break it down into an mvp so I can build this and get something out

I‚Äôm not looking for general crypto risks, like regulation, 51% attacks, getting your wallet hacked or locked out of your wallet.  I want Eth-specific risks!! 

Here‚Äôs a few I can think of off the top of my head, but like I said - I‚Äôm a noobie.

1. If Vitalik disappears, will Eth pull through long-term? While he doesnt want any power, from what I can tell he‚Äôs kind of the life blood of the project

2. New entrants. Cardano is getting pretty popular, and you have to imagine other Ethereum-type networks will make an attempt

3. Something about high fees and or slow transactions? Even after EIP 1599 and Eth2...there will likely always be a cheaper/faster alternative

ethereum,How to get FREE PIZZA TODAY on Bitcoin Pizza Day,"[Twitter going brrrr with free pizza!](https://twitter.com/search?q=rarepizzas&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live)

Today is a sacred day in the cryptocurrency space. On May 22, 2010 Laszlo Hanyecz made the first ever Bitcoin transaction, trading 10,000 bitcoin for two large pizzas. Today, crypto enthusiasts celebrate this milestone occasion by sharing some slices of pizza.

How to get some FREE PIZZA TODAY:

* Check our [Rarepizzas CRM](http://crm.rarepizzas.com/) to see if you have a pizzeria nearby that was onboarded, in the Pizzeria Tracker tab. We gave to each of these pizzerias $500 worth of pizza to give away to their communities, with an additional $150 tip for their work.
* If you live in the USA you can use [Slice](http://slicelife.com) to get a fresh pie delivered by entering the code FREEPIZZADAY. We bought 1 bitcoin worth of pizza redeemable through Slice‚Äôs network of 16,000 pizza shops.
* We also partnered with [Bitcoin Pizza](https://www.eatbitcoinpizza.com/) so you can get a fresh pie for free while supporting the Human Rights Foundation's Bitcoin Development Fund. We are giving away 1000 bitcoin pizzas! Stay tuned for the announcement!
* Order your pizza, snap a picture and post it on #Twitter [and send us a receipt](http://pizzaproof.com/).

More about Rarepizzas:

* On March 14, 2021 (Pi Day) we sold digital collectible Rare Pizzas Box NFTs that will open to reveal a unique, generated pie on June 28. So far, we‚Äôve raised over $1M USD which will go to buying the world pizza, with a portion going to the artists and contributors who helped coordinate this momentous project. Collectors can get a box by visiting [Rarepizzas Store](https://www.rarepizzas.com/store) or [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/rare-pizzas-box), there will only be 10,000 of these made and they are sold on a bonding curve.
* All this free pizza is possible thanks to PizzaDAO and the efforts of a community with 100+ members and the collaboration of 300+ artists that participated in the Rare Pizzas generative art project.
* We also donated over $30,000 USD to charities across the world to throw local pizza parties. This includes feeding hundreds of kids and elderly households across the world.
* Why are you doing this? We believe that pizza should be free, or at least once a year. We want to celebrate a world wide party every year in which pizza is free, for Laszlo! And we want to do it with mainstream adoption!

ethereum,Ethereum max drawdown from peak?,"Got roughly 40 ETH at 1.2k - 1.5k. Debating whether I should sell now or not. I will need the money by year end.

Here are my rough calculations on what my predictions for the max drawdown can be based on Bitcoin's last bull cycle (since it had a similar market cap as Ethereum at the time.). 

\---------------------------------------------------------------

Bitcoin Max Price 2017: $19,783 - December 

Bitcoin Market Cap 2017: $330 Billion. 

Bitcoin lowest price 2020 COVID dump: $3191

Bitcoin Market cap 2020 COVID dump: $53.2 billion. 

Lowest Price/Highest Price last bull market cycle percentage: **16.1%**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

Ethereum Max price 2021: $4370

Ethereum Max Market Cap: $505 billion 

Ethereum max market cap of 2021/Bitcoin Max marketcap of 2017 bull run = **1.53x**

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Prediction for lowest price IF we enter a bear market:** 

Max drawdown as a percentage = (Lowest Price/Highest Price last bull market cycle percentage) \* (Ethereum max market cap of 2021/Bitcoin Max marketcap of 2017 bull run)

1.53 \* 16.1% = 24.633%

24.633% \* Ethereum Max price of 2021 ($4370) = **$1076**

However, i would argue that ethereum being used for actual day to day transactions would add a lot more value than just making coin owners richer. To do that you're going to need to make transactions free or almost free.

Therefore if that's the case, why charge a base fee at all if it just gets burnt and doesn't provide an incentive to miners? Not having a base fee would essentially make transactions free except for the network contested cases where you need to provide a tip to the miner.",1621666552,horsey-the-blue,True,1,32,2021-05-22

ethereum,It does not matter how high or low the price is.,"Dips don‚Äôt matter Highs don‚Äôt matter. All that matters is that we get away from the traditional financial system. The get rich quick mentality draws in the wrong people. 

What I‚Äôm getting at is the reason why eth and some other cryptos are valuable is not because of their price potential. It is the potential to revolutionize the financial sector eventually every other aspect of the world.
The reason why I hold is because I trust ETH and see the revolution ahead and being part of the revolution is reason enough. 

Another reason why I don‚Äôt sell my crypto in general and take profits is because I don‚Äôt trust fiat enough. For my value to be stored  in a government asset that are performing a rug-pull on us seems riskier. 
All I need to know is that in a year from now 1 eth will equal 1eth and no government can take that away. 

What I should ad: don‚Äôt invest money you don‚Äôt have for some moonshot dream. Create a portfolio and don‚Äôt touch it. If you do that it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs the peak of the bull run or is just starting. The rich don‚Äôt sell their assets they keep them forever and borrow against it.

ethereum,Things You Need To Know To Create a Successful Career In The NFT Industry,"## tl;dr

&gt;Don‚Äôt be afraid to get creative. Lots of platforms support lots of formats ‚Äî NFTs can be much more than things that collect digital dust. Try experimenting with minting code, PDFs, 3D models, even interactive games. Those who push boundaries are often rewarded. Our example is the RMRK2.0 standards ‚Äî without pushing the boundaries on what NFTs can and should be able to do, we would still be stuck in Ethereum-land with simple collectibles that do nothing. But because we dared to move fast and break things to reach a point of extreme innovation, we succeeded.

‚óã‚óã‚óã

M*any have observed that we are at the cusp of an NFT boom. The thing is, it‚Äôs so cutting edge, that many people don‚Äôt know what it is. What exactly is an NFT and how can one create a lucrative career out of selling them? To address this, as a part of our interview series called ‚Äú5 Things You Need To Know To Create a Highly Successful Career In The NFT Industry‚Äù, we had the pleasure of interviewing* *Bruno ≈†kvorc.*

*Bruno is an Ethereum OG who started out with training web2 developers on moving to web3 back in 2015. Since then he‚Äôs worked on Ethereum 2.0 and most recently as a technical educator in the Web3 Foundation which is spearheading the development of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. He‚Äôs been working on RMRK, a protocol for minting NFTs on the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem, since Q4 2020, when he noticed the NFT boom ramping up again and felt like it would be a shame for Kusama to miss out on it.*

‚óã‚óã‚óã

**Thank you so much for doing this with us! Before we dig in, our readers would like to get to know you a bit. Can you tell us a bit about your backstory and how you grew up?**

Igrew up in Croatia, a small odd-shaped country in the Mediterranean. I used to be into animation and games as a child, so I became a Flash developer in my adolescence. Best development experience of my life, still. I then moved into web development and later on, as Ethereum came about, into web3 development. The rest is history, I got hooked on blockchain and never left. In whatever free time I find I like to be in VR, or go bouldering, running, or otherwise relax in some way with my wife, daughter, and beagle.

**Is there a particular book, film, or podcast that made a significant impact on you? Can you share a story or explain why it resonated with you so much?**

I only remember Fight Club as the first ‚Äúhigh IQ‚Äù movie I saw. I was unfamiliar with crazy twists until then. This made me pursue all non-action movies since, and so I‚Äôve built quite a portfolio in my head. Interestingly, while none of this resonated too much with me in terms of impacts, it did drive me into piracy ‚Äî I collected so many movies people wanted to buy them off me, so I bought a CD burner and started dealing movies no one else had yet in a little country such as Croatia. It was a fun part of my life for sure, one that luckily ended well (with me quitting the venture, and not jail, haha).

**Is there a particular story that inspired you to pursue a career in this new industry? We‚Äôd love to hear it.**

Well, even just one single generation ago all the information my parents got was coming from state-sanctioned media: newspapers, TV, radio. With internet, that all changed, but now it‚Äôs changing again into censorship and political ideology, not to mention the financial imprisonment where a few institutions get to decide what YOU get to do with YOUR money.

So decentralization, censorship resistance, and the permission-less nature of public blockchains like Ethereum is what drew me to this space. I want to build technology that offers people a choice between total freedom and the safety of institutions.

If someone wants bank insurance but negative interest rates, that‚Äôs fine. But if someone wants 50% yearly interest in highly risky ventures, or wants to invest in tokenized real estate across the ocean, they should be able to do that too without having to ask anyone for permission.

**Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began this fascinating career?**

I sold a crypto cat in 2017 for more money than my parents earn together in a year.

This was the craze of CryptoKitties back in 2017 as the first NFT wave hit the blockchain world. The game was so popular it crashed Ethereum at the time ‚Äî well, not crashed, but increased fees so much it became too expensive to use Ethereum. Fun fact ‚Äî that wave wasn‚Äôt even 10% of what we‚Äôre experiencing right now on Ethereum with DeFi, and yet no one seems to mind because there‚Äôs so much more we can do on the blockchain than we could back then.

**Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?**

I learned not to day trade against the house by losing a whole bitcoin on Bitmex :) I have no idea when exactly that was, I think around 2017.

I learned about this concept of betting on bitcoin price by betting with bitcoin. I decided to try it out and, of course, I used 100x leverage right off the bat. A few bad calls later I learned my lesson ‚Äî up until then I had never traded, only invested in ICOs and developed. So this first trading experience made me learn what‚Äôs going on here actually, and since then I grew as a trader as well, I think.

It‚Äôs a type of expensive mistake everyone has to make before succeeding in this space, there‚Äôs just no other way to learn ‚Äî other people‚Äôs mistakes simply do not teach. Not sure why that is, but once you burn yourself you kind of ‚Äúlevel up‚Äù.

**None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?**

Sure, Ophelie Lechat from [SitePoint.com](http://sitepoint.com/) was my boss when I was editor of the PHP tutorial channel there. I‚Äôve learned a ton from her, and this prepared me for a very fruitful writing and editing career in education ‚Äî this was the base on which all my work since then rests.

This was a job I had for some 5 years before blockchain, and I was in charge of \~100 authors producing community-sourced tutorial content on this extremely popular technical education website. It took a lot of effort of wrangle all those people, verify their code, and fix their writing, and through guidance from Ophelie I believe I matured from ‚Äújust a guy a bit higher up the ladder‚Äù to ‚Äúcompetent lead‚Äù at the very least. With her help I also introduced some new concepts like Peer Review into technical writing of community sourced material, something I‚Äôve since taken into two other jobs to form two similar community in a similarly successful way.

**Are you working on any exciting new projects now? How do you think that will help people?**

We have just launched an NFT minting and trading UI on the Kusama blockchain. It‚Äôs called Singular, can be found at [singular.rmrk.app](http://singular.rmrk.app/), and it lets anyone mint clean (eco) NFTs for as little as 3 cents, and sell them to others. This is part of a big NFT drive on the Kusama network, and a huge ecosystem expansion plan ‚Äî our focus is UX optimization so we want to make it all easy to use as possible.

Additionally, the standard will spread out between all the chains that connect to Kusama. Kusama is the chain that‚Äôs focused on connecting different blockchains together ‚Äî like connecting Bitcoin to Ethereum and to Monero. In many ways it‚Äôs a tide that rises all boats ‚Äî and our NFT standards are standards that will go to all those connected chains just through that connection. It‚Äôs all very exciting!

**Ok super. Thank you for all that. Let‚Äôs now shift to the main focus of our interview. I‚Äôm sure you get this question all the time. But for the benefit of our readers, can you explain in your own words what an NFT is, and why people are spending so much money on them?**

An NFT is anything that can be presented in a way that is unique to the observer. So a concert ticket, even if one of many, is special to the concert goer because it‚Äôs Theirs, same with art and similar. In layman‚Äôs terms, an NFT is quite simply just a database records of you having \*something\* that is not interchangeable with other \*somethings\* of the same type.

It‚Äôs important to note that fungibility (interchangeability) is a spectrum. Something that‚Äôs fungible to you may not be fungible to me. For example, my cat and your cat are non fungible ‚Äî we don‚Äôt consider them identical. But two same-looking purple swords in a video game might be fungible to me and non fungible to you ‚Äî you may value looks, in which case it doesn‚Äôt matter which one you have, but I may value the sword‚Äôs attributes and in that case they are absolutely non fungible to me.

**The NFT industry seems so exciting right now. What are the 3 things in particular that most excite you about the industry? If you can, please share a story or example for each.**

Composeable NFTs are very exciting to me ‚Äî NFTs owning NFTs to alter visual and functional experiences. NFTs as DAOs also make sense ‚Äî people democratically governing NFT functionality. And of course, multi-resource NFTs so NFTs can be multiple things at once. We call these Art Legos, and we built them as part of RMRK2.0, so this enables a very exciting use case. Imagine: a big digital billboard in some metaverse VR space, and then this billboard can have its shareholders (DAO) and big brands like Coca Cola and Pepsi can send it the ad they want to display on the billboard. So now the tokenholders of this NFT can decide which ad to show, and the corporations have to pay the tokenholders to vote a certain way. The billboard is an NFT, the land it is placed on is an NFT, and the texture of the ad to display is an NFT. You suddenly have community-governed metaverse real estate!

**What are the 3 things that concern you about the industry? Can you explain? What can be done to address those concerns?**

Lots of people are minting just for the sake of minting and making money, and it‚Äôs all kind of losing its appeal due to lack of quality.

I‚Äôm also worried about the fees ‚Äî people are paying too much unnecesarily, when they could be using almost free minting on something like the Kusama blockchain.

Lastly, I don‚Äôt think the approach taken by many NFT platforms is long-term healthy ‚Äî too many rely on centralized servers to host the NFT assets, and so if those companies go bust, the NFTs do too. Missing the point of blockchain, no?

Instead, NFT assets should be hosted on something like IPFS so they can be fetched by any client at any time even if the project stops existing. You wouldn‚Äôt like your mona lisa to render a ‚Äú404 image not found‚Äù 5 years after you buy it, right?

**What are the ‚Äúmyths‚Äù that you would like to dispel about NFTs? Can you explain what you mean?**

There‚Äôs a myth that an NFT is forever because it‚Äôs ‚Äúon the blockchain‚Äù. But because many projects and companies rely on third party centralized hosting solutions to keep those assets around, if those central points of failures fail, then the NFTs disappear. Owners of the NFTs are left with an empty husk of what they once purchased. People should instead always check how an NFT is built, and how much of a longevity potential it has.

Another myth is that NFTs are bad for the environment. That‚Äôs a very silly gotcha attempted by the anti-NFT crowd, but in fact, those blocks would be mined regardless, and there‚Äôs plenty of Proof-of-Stake alternatives which don‚Äôt mine at all and thus don‚Äôt pollute at all ‚Äî our platform [singular.rmrk.app](http://singular.rmrk.app/) is built on one such chain so minting a thousand NFTs costs about as much energy as it would take nature to dissolve a breadcrumb.

**What are the most common mistakes you have seen people make when they enter the NFT industry. What can be done to avoid that?**

Minting on Ethereum while gas prices are high, and paying thousands of dollars in fees :) They should wait for low gas prices (hard to do!) or just move to a cheaper platform.

The other mistake is not estimating their value properly ‚Äî too many people undersell themselves, while others oversell themselves ‚Äî both base their prices on outliers when they should be following averages and the wisdom of the crowd. In particular, Crypto Twitter is a good measure of current popularity.

**How do you think NFTs have the potential to help society in the future?**

NFTs as irrevocable passes and reputation-cards for access to platforms and protocols or even to track COVID vaccinated people are not far off. But here‚Äôs a more interesting case I am passionate about: in 5 years, we‚Äôll all be wearing augmented reality glasses or lenses that have the ability to DELETE advertisements we see around us in the real world. What if you could sell that ad-space as NFTs to corporations and ad agencies you actually agree with, so you only see what you‚Äôre interested in?

**Ok, fantastic. Here is the main question of our interview. What are your ‚Äú5 Things You Need To Know To Create a Highly Successful Career In The NFT Industry?‚Äù (Please share a story or example for each.)**

1. As an artist, it‚Äôs usually better to be good than plentiful (quality over quantity) but when there‚Äôs a crazy bull market, there‚Äôs no shame in taking advantage of it. Publish \*everything\*, feel shame later when you‚Äôre rich.
2. As a developer, the market has never been more ripe for disruption because it‚Äôs all disrupted all the time anyway. Go forth and hack! Build stuff that interacts with existing NFTs and maybe extends their functionality, and fame and fortune are yours. See what we did with RMRK ‚Äî the Billboard example is a great one: [https://url.rmrk.app/deck](https://url.rmrk.app/deck)
3. If you have an idea about an excellent and highly complex NFT system, get in touch with us at [hello@rmrk.app](mailto:hello@rmrk.app) ‚Äî our Art Lego system lets you build anything, and if it doesn‚Äôt, we‚Äôll change it so it does. Anything is possible, and you‚Äôre just one daring and brave idea experiment away from success.
4. Using Ethereum is smart because it has the biggest audience, but don‚Äôt be shy about publishing your work on all the available platforms ‚Äî Tezos is great with Hic et nunc, and Singular on Kusama is amazing (humblebrag). Diversify your portfolio of art platforms just like you do your portfolio of coins!
5. Don‚Äôt be afraid to get creative. Lots of platforms support lots of formats ‚Äî NFTs can be much more than things that collect digital dust. Try experimenting with minting code, PDFs, 3D models, even interactive games. Those who push boundaries are often rewarded. Our example is the RMRK2.0 standards ‚Äî without pushing the boundaries on what NFTs can and should be able to do, we would still be stuck in Ethereum-land with simple collectibles that do nothing. But because we dared to move fast and break things to reach a point of extreme innovation, we succeeded.

**You are a person of great influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)**

Start educating your friends and family about basic financial hygiene ‚Äî no banks, no loans, no credit, no mortgage. Go cash only, and then crypto. No savings account, save in DeFi. Try to interact with the blockchain world as much as possible, join the parallel economy and exit the tax-infested world of fiat. Unlock the potential of YOUR money without asking anyone for permissions, and you‚Äôll encounter incredible amounts of freedom.

**We are very blessed that very prominent leaders read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US with whom you would like to have a private breakfast or lunch, and why? He or she might just see this if we tag them :-)**

I would like to have breakfast with Joe Rogan, just to see what a high-octane steak-breakfast looks like.

**Thank you so much for these excellent stories and insights. We wish you continued success on your great work!**

ethereum,Binance-Peg XRP and Binance-Peg Ethereum with TrustWallet in U.S.,"I know the title is quite long, but I've never tried to withdraw any crypto I've invested in on TrustWallet before. Saying that I'm frustrated and confused is by far an understatement. Pardon my ignorance with this post, but I am in need of some help here.

&amp;#x200B;

I converted my crypto over to Ethereum (or so I thought) so I could send that ETH from TrustWallet to Uphold, since I know I can withdraw or cash-out when using Uphold. When I converted it to ETH, I now have ""Binance-Peg XRP."" I tried to convert some to Ethereum since I saw that, and then I received ""Binance-Peg Ethereum.""

&amp;#x200B;

After doing some digging, I saw that I would need to ""peg out,"" but the only way I've seen to do that is by using Binance Chain Extension (Bridge) but I'm unable to do so due to living in the United States apparently. So, needless to say... I'm stuck and don't see a way to retrieve my original investment nor my profits.

Doge is a great springboard for newcomers and I've made decent returns due to getting in early. Its been a lot of fun and I hope it continues to do well to provide people with similar opportunities

Some of the things that I found very interesting:

""Blockchain is a decentralized system that has some kind of a shared memory""

""A good blockchain application is one that a. needs decentralization b. needs some kind of shared memory""

Bitcoin =&gt; Protocol in service of the currency; Etherum =&gt; Currency in service of the protocol

Crypto Currencies is a natural transition of trust: In God we trust -&gt; In nation we trust -&gt; In math we trust, An this theory ultimately disrupts traditional power structures. 

The last point I found to be very interesting, China's recent crackdown into cryptocurrency is just retaliation against this disruption. It's just beautiful that we continue to grow

Devs look like they‚Äôre porting to cross chain interoperability to Cardano, which could stoke take away from ETH.
Is anyone considering other chains as the ETH competition heats up?

ethereum,Who decide each transaction cost how many Gas?,"Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. Based on my understandings of gas price: 

1. GWEI (unit of gas): is fixed 0.000000001 ETH no matter what

2. Gas price vary and it‚Äôs usually 40 GWEI to 300 GWEI depending on time, demand, transactor‚Äôs bid, the verification speed they want.

3. A basic standard ERC20 transfer cost 21000 Gas. Other smart contracts might be cost more. My question is who decide how many Gas each transaction cost? Is there a fixed amount set for each category of transaction? Or the number of Gas also varies for each transaction? If so, I hear it‚Äôs the user who can submit the gas limit and system would return the unused limit back to your wallet. But when I registered for OpenSea and verified a smart contract when it used to confirm my user account, my MetaMask wallet didn‚Äôt provide my the option to choose how many gas I want to spend, nor did it show me the speed I can choose from. It just show me the value of ETH (the gas price) for this transaction and I can only choose to accept it or not. 

So I don‚Äôt understand :1. Who decide how many Gas it cost for this transaction? Is it OpenSea or it‚Äôs a prefixed number for each type of transaction in Ethereum network, or the market itself? 2. In which scenario of transactions can I have the option to manually confirm the speed regards to how many GWEI I accept? Or in my case, is OpenSea automatically choose the fastest speed for all its users?

ethereum,ETH 2.0 trade offs,"I'm struggling to understand the path of current ETH to ETH 2.0.

As far as I understood, the high gas fees make ETH very impractical to use on most apps. I made that experience when trying to use some of the apps that run on ethereum's blockchain.

PoS is going to solve this problem, but there's something I don't really understand about it. 

The more ETH you have, the more ETH you will get from staking, and as far as I understood you need at least 32 ETH to do so. This is an amount most people will never be able to afford. To me, this seems that ETH 2.0 is only favouring the rich. 
I got into crypto to break out from this wheel, to be able to convert my cash into an asset that is favouring those people who hold it, like for example the halving in Bitcoin does. 

What is Ethereum trying to be, and how is it different than the fundamentals of the dollar? (Except from a transparent blockchain and apps built on it?)

ethereum,Can high ETH fees be used to front run trades?,"ETH has been extremely volatile this past week. Paying high gas fees enables people to send their transactions to the front of the blockchain. It leads me to wonder: can hedge funds/exchanges manipulate the market by paying high gas fees to front run retail investors?  

For example, if a hedge fund pays $100,000 USD in ETH gas per trade, their trades would be the first ones executed. They could spike or drop a crypto in milliseconds. Then, by using highly leverage derivative contracts, they could reap massive profits. 

Does anyone here have enough expertise in blockchain/ETH/crypto to determine if this is possible? Or does blockchain make front running impossible? 

Thank you!",1621530028,ByronCorp,True,1,10,2021-05-21

ethereum,The Future of Crypto or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying About What Coin is 'Best',"source: blockcahinexplained.org

The year is 2025 and the US economy has begun to boom after a history-book recession. Stocks are full-steam ahead and BTC is on it's way to the moon. (see FAQ ""What is a Halving"")  


Amazon has launched their flagship token, SmileCoin. SmileCoin is a stable coin (always worth $1) and can be used as cash for any purchase (including Amazon Web Services). Using the Decentralized Finance model, by keeping your SmileCoin in your Amazon ""wallet,"" Amazon pays you back 7% APY (in SmileCoins), better than any traditional banking account can compete with.  


Because Amazon is no longer paying credit card transaction fees, Visa, MasterCard, and AMEX have all burrowed their way into ""HODL"" positions for SmileCoin.  


What if Amazon doesn‚Äôt deliver the fresh produce you like? For a $5 transaction fee you can use ""TokenSwap"" to convert 100 SmileCoins to 7800 GroceryBucks or .0004 GoldCoins.  


Don‚Äôt want to wait in line? Everything from supply chain to payments are on the public blockchain. Walk into the store, open the ""wallet"" on your phone, take a picture of the UPC (to add to cart), and then scan a check-out QR code at the security desk (to make sure you're only taking out what you've scanned, of course).  


But alas, the tax man cometh and how are 'they' dealt in? Do individual governments deserve a stake in our globally-decentralized ""coins""? They can buy coins (from us!), they can run mining nodes and store all of our data, but they can never manipulate the supply again.

ethereum,Some fundamental Blockchain Questions,"Hi everyone, I hope I am in the correct subreddit for my questions. I am reading up more and more about Blockchains (currently reading The Token Economy), but there are still many questions popping up in my head and Google search isn't always helpful because there are lots of articles which are not going very deep into the topic. Maybe someone here can help me out with some blockchain fundamentals or point me to the right resources:  


1. What's the relation between blockchain and wallet in regards to \*\*what data is stored and managed\*\* by each entity? As I understand, the blockchain keeps track of all transactions while the wallet generates ones private key, public key, and address. If the wallet generates those, how does the blockchain know that there is a new participant in the network? I am guessing the blockchain doesn't know about this participant, until the new participants sends their first transaction to the blockchain. But I am not sure about this.
2. How is the problem of quantum computing taken care of in the example of Ethereum/Ethereum 2.0? If quantum computing becomes a thing, it should get easier for these to decrypt public key from address and private key from public key.
3. If a blockchain stores only transactions, how does the blockchain know how much token every participant in the network holds? Does the wallet with your address aggregate all your historical transactions on the blockchain to the result?
4. A block in a blockchain consists of transactions. If a transaction is made, it's broadcasted to all nodes which verify the transaction. Once there are enough transactions, a block is created. Question(s): Do all nodes in the network start to create this block at the same time? And if so, will they abort their work if one node (the winner) broadcasts its block? What I am wondering here: what's the timeline of these events and for each event what does each node do?
5. Why has a wallet public key and address if both are accessible by others once a first transaction is sent?
6. If a block is hashed upon creation, how do block explorer applications know how to de-hash the block? Is the hash function known and always the same?
   1. Are transactions in a block hashed as well?
7. How is it taken care of that there are no duplicated private keys if the wallets do not know about each other. I know that there must be a function which creates this randomness, but how to guarantee its uniqueness?
8. If a person sends a transaction, as I understand the transaction is send as plaintext and as a hash. Then nodes can hash the plaintext and verify if its the same with the hash. Why sending a hash and a plaintext in the first place? My guess: Making sure of the integrity of the transaction, so that no one tampered with it in between, but I am not 100% sure if this is the reason and/or whether there are other reasons.
9. If one sends a transaction to the blockchain, how do nodes get notified about this? Do they just sync every X seconds with the latest transactions on the network?  


There are many more questions I need to dig deeper, but I don't want to flood this subreddit and need to do my own research as well. Thanks for your kindness!",1621449417,dredaniel,True,1,7,2021-05-20

I'm still kinda new to mining and stuff, but there's something that's not clear for me.

I have a steady 319MH/s but in week 1 I'm earning like 0.1 ETH and in week 2 like 0.12 ETH. First this was very stable but now, in the changing crypto markets, it's very unstable.

What causes that variableness? I watched a YouTube video the other day and this guy was saying something like: ""when money is going out or in"", but that just confuses me. Can someone explain this to me? And maybe some examples?

What Happened: The StopElon (CRYPTO: STOPELON) cryptocurrency saw a major price uptick after the community took a grudge against the tech tycoon.

The official website of the token in question explains that it aims ""to destroy the biggest market manipulator of them all.""

StopElon's plan is to use the capital raised through the project to gain full control of Tesla stock and fire the firm's CEO. The developers also took some additional steps to make the coin attractive to investors, like destroying 40% of the token's supply and then distributing 6% of the transaction fees back to the token holders.",1621398121,PeacockMamba,True,1,20,2021-05-19

ethereum,Need Help with Uniswap v3,"Hello Ethereans, I'm adept in DeFi and successfully migrated my Balancer pools to V2. However, I'm struggling with the Uniswap because I'm not a trader. I understand the liquidity concentration V3 is doing and I followed their guide on how to migrate, but I'm stuck on the part where I select minimum and maximum range for my liquidity. 

The example in the docs is easy because it's ETH / DAI so the pricing is in a stablecoin. All my pools are separate digital assets so it's not priced in a stablecoin. Can someone walk me through how I determine the range of my liquidity? 

For example, let's use wBTC / ETH. I know ETH is currently at .07 BTC. I'm a conservative LP so I don't want to be constantly updating my range. I'm comfortable with a .03 - .2 wBTC range for ETH. I only want to update the liquidity range every 6 months or a year. However, every time I was messing with the numbers to migrate it kept saying my liquidity was off and I'd get liquidity returned to me. 

I also have other LP tokens with non-stablecoin assets in the Ethereum ecosystem so my preference is to understand how I come up with the range so I can do this on my own in the future. Thank you.",1621387146,tpmv69,True,1,1,2021-05-19

ethereum,Ethereum 3.0 - A Roadmap to Zero Fees and Instant Transfers,"1) Zero fees - I think that after adoption progresses it will make sense to move in a direction where there are zero fees - this will remove roadblocks from lots of transactions and enable efficient commerce.

2) Instant transfers - We will need to further reduce transaction time.

3) Reduce network dependency - Allow transactions in emergency situations and where there is no network access or limited access. This is key to a progressive equitable world for everyone.

Each ETH can be represented by something physical. It should be small, durable but also hard enough to counterfit that society has trust in it's value. A blend of materials like paper and cotton can be used to make a small square or rectangle voucher that will fit into your pocket. Because it is thin, you can fit many into your pocket and this will also provide for a layer of redundancy so that you are not dependent on a network in order to pay for something. People won't even need their phones to conduct transactions, they can give these voucher notes to each other instead.

This would enable instant transactions on-the-spot with zero fees and would be a true economic steroid. Enabling that type of commerce would allow for markets to popup all over and people would make monies.

For example, with [QETH](https://3iq.ca/the-ether-fund-qethu-qethun/), they're currently trading at a 10% discount compared to NAV.

My thinking is that, to take advantage of this situation, you would sell ETH and buy QETH when there's a sufficient discount (e.g. &gt;5%) to offset any transaction fees. And when the discount gap closes or turns into a premium, you would sell QETH and buy ETH.

Assumptions:
1. Negligble third party risk because these funds that are traded on stock exchanges are usually insured or protected somehow.
2. QETH discount is due to short-term market volatility that will disappear in the medium-term.

ethereum,PSA: Kraken potentially eating deposits &lt;0.05 ETH (~$165)," Kraken has an odd ""minimum deposit"" rule of 0.05 ETH.

This is noted on the deposit page, so nothing nefarious if the funds go into limbo when the amount is below that.

However, what's appalling is:- Kraken only allows 5 addresses at a time. If you generate any more, it expires the old addresses- Kraken doesn't show addresses receiving &lt;0.05 ETH as ""used"", so you have no idea if there's deposits in limbo on it- Once the generated address expires because you added new ones, funds sent to the old ones are unrecoverable- Once an address is expired, there's no ""previous addresses"" history page

I have confirmed all this with Kraken support. They didn't find the lack of disclosure concerning, or that addresses with limbo deposits unbeknownst to the user may be expiring.

Of course, I would love to know how many of my prior expired addresses had limbo deposits, but they can't provide this. Nor can I know since the previous addresses are not displayed in their UI.

This seems to be a recurring issue:- [https://www.reddit.com/r/KrakenSupport/comments/kq9hfv/accidentally\_sent\_less\_than\_minimum\_eth/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KrakenSupport/comments/kq9hfv/accidentally_sent_less_than_minimum_eth/)\- [https://www.reddit.com/r/KrakenSupport/comments/nevysa/accidentally\_deposited\_less\_than\_the\_minimum\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KrakenSupport/comments/nevysa/accidentally_deposited_less_than_the_minimum_of/)

With the ETH price where it is, these might not be trivial sums going into Kraken's pocket. There's no accountability or disclosure of it, which I find frustrating.

I love Kraken, but can't see eye-to-eye on this. My recommendation would have been to not expire old addresses and show the ones with limbo deposits as ""pending"" (not unused!). However, their support doesn't feel anything needs to change.

So I ask the community: Am I in the wrong to find this concerning?

ethereum,"ELI5: Decentralized exchanges and ""presales""","I've recently started using Uniswap. It's great, apart from all the scams. Short of just rugging, there seem to be a lot of new projects that have their liquidity provided through a ""presale"", which seems to be just the owner allocating tokens to his own wallets. Besides from that, the majority of these projects offer fake promises (Coingecko listing soon! etc), and encourage other people to shill for them. What I'm wondering is how is this so commonplace? Is crypto really that much of a greyzone where creating your own project and then dumping on the people who buy isn't actually illegal? Is this just the same group of people making new projects over and over again? Both? I'm just having a hard time wrapping my head around this. 

If anyone more educated on this topic could perhaps explain this to me that would be much appreciated. Google seems to bring up ambiguous results.

My apologies if this question does not belong here. I figured since Uniswap is an exchange for ERC20 tokens this might be an ok place to ask.

ethereum,The Future of Trading has arrived," 

After the successful launch of SafeGalaxy, we knew we had to do more. Something Bigger. Much Bigger. So on May 17, 2021, we will be launching our very own DEX, GalaxySwap.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ojhin99uktz61.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd934ad74b9a5b6521c8c8a1a3d640cf73782293

To kick off the launch of GalaxySwap, we are going to be doing a Giveaway of 10 Million Galaxia, per day, for 15 days. That‚Äôs a total of 150 Million Galaxia. To redeem your free Galaxia, you will need to connect your Wallet to GalaxySwap, and then login to GalaxySwap every day for 15 days to hit the Redeem button and claim your Galaxia. And yes, Redeeming your Galaxia will be as simple as pressing the ‚Äúredeem‚Äù button. Here are the minimum requirements for the giveaway.

You must hold $300+ worth of SafeGalaxy in your wallet. That‚Äôs it.

Anybody who holds More than $300 worth of SafeGalaxy in their wallet can participate. Because the price of SafeGalaxy fluctuates, on any given day, more or less people will be eligible for the giveaway. This means you will receive different rewards every single day, based on the number of people in the giveaway.

The amount you receive will be based on a logarithmic function, with the largest amount given to the largest wallet, and the lowest amount given to those holding $300. This is to ensure that while the largest holders do indeed earn more free Galaxia, it will not be an absurd amount compared to smaller wallets. This is the most fair way to support everyone who has supported us.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8xk5s5w0ltz61.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db46629b2e505c0200506b96592645717321a573

How are we going to fund GalaxySwap? We are going to be pulling from the SafeGalaxy/BNB Pool on Pancacke swap to Fund GalaxySwap. The BNB will be used to fund the initial liquidity for GalaxySwap, and the Safe Galaxy‚Ä¶ To get out of the atmosphere, we need to kick in the Afterburners. We need to burn.

To get us going, we are going to be burning a total of 22 TRILLION SafeGalaxy over the next 17 days. This is roughly $1,000,000 worth of SafeGalaxy.

3.5 Trillion tokens were Burnt May 15, 2021.

3.5 Trillion tokens were Burnt May 16, 2021.

1 Trillion SafeGalaxy will then be burnt every single day, for 15 days during the giveaways.

Everyone gets Galaxia = Everyone Makes Money = Everybody Wins.

Once Galaxy Swap Launches, The entire game changes.

To Start, You will have the capability to Farm the Following Pairs:

* SafeGalaxy/Galaxia
* Galaxia/BNB
* Galaxia/BUSD
* BNB/BUSD

And you will be able to join the following Pools:

* SafeGalaxy -&gt; Get Galaxia
* Galaxia -&gt; Get Galaxia

This will allow anyone who is currently holding SafeGalaxy, to earn Galaxia just by staking their SafeGalaxy. It‚Äôs the best of both worlds.  
The price of Galaxia is aimed to start around $0.10, and we couldn‚Äôt be more excited about the potential. Especially if you look at the current price of Cake, we just can‚Äôt help but smile. Our last token, SafeGalaxy, went up 300%+ after launch, and we have a very good feeling about Galaxia.

&amp;#x200B;

We‚Äôre launching on May 17th, and this is just the beginning. The future of GalaxySwap, Galaxia, SafeGalaxy,and the entire GalaxyProtocol will be an exciting one, and we can‚Äôt wait to see what lies ahead. We‚Äôve made it to Infinity, It‚Äôs time to see what‚Äôs beyond.

ethereum,Noob Question: Is Ethereum and other coins impossible to counterfeit?,"The thought came to my mind thinking about the inherent benefits of crypto over cash but I'm just learning about this stuff. I ask about Ethereum in particular because I feel that there's a lot more development projects behind it, but I don't know if this is actually true because of the nature of crypto itself.   


Is it impossible to counterfeit crypto? If it's not, is Ethereum better at protecting itself over these kinds of events? Are all cryptocurrencies impossible to counterfeit or one of them have an advantage over the others? Is this discussed as a benefit over fiat money?  


Sorry about my ignorance and I'd love to hear what you guys know/think about this, I think a lot of people only concentrate on the trading aspects which is cool, but I'd really like to learn more about the fundaments around cryptocurrency, especially Ethereum.

ethereum,How's the ETH pair doing?...,"I just made $15,000 within a day (which is big for me). But I made a rookie mistake. 

Instead of putting it into stable coins, I put it into Ethereum to maximize the gain a little in what I felt was one of the safer asset classes relatively speaking. The plan was to then put it into stable coins and then CDA over a period of time into a hand picked list of alt coins. 

This would have been a good strategy had I been allowed to do it... 

But this was the day before Elon shat on Bitcoin. Yeah... 

At the time Ethereum was $4.1k. And then it dropped all the way down to 3k.

I don't want to sell until it gets back to 4.1k but I am also afraid of missing out on the opportunity cost of alts in the meantime.

If someone were to do it, and make it so that no commission was taken with the Dapp Kickstarter contrary to the classical Kickstarter, offering the same service, wouldn‚Äôt it kill the company ?

I just never saw it that way, because that's how many people make it out to be.

 How can we be so sure that individual companies using blockchain tech in the future do not misuse or manipulate the tech? Can we really put so much faith into our privacy and data being secure when at the end of the day we still rely on whichever company/provider it is that provides us a particular service, even though the tech they're using is Blockchain. 

Maybe I'm missing things here. But I feel like just because the tech has all the pros, it does not mean it is free from being manipulated by the companies that use it to sell us their services and products. So where lies the decentralisation?",1621280535,trvis-xo,True,1,19,2021-05-18

ethereum,"A lot of fiat simps over the last 48 hours shilling away, blaming Musk, etc, don't get this one thing...","Reddit is a pro-crypto and super crypto tolerant place overall, between r/bitcoin, this sub, and the fact that reddit's whole coin system runs on ETH -- over last day or so have seen a lot of unintellectually presented stuff hit the reddit homepage just bashing us and BTC. This post is meant for such haters, who are no doubt browsing this sub, it's not meant for people who've been in for years as it will be a repeat of values you already understand well.

Red Herring 1: ""Why would they go into this scam that ONE MAN can change the value of by so much?""

Well, caught a fresh red herring right there, didn't ya. I don't see evidence that Elon Musk is singlehandedly keeping the crypto markets alive. Mainstream narrative being propped up by fools. I don't check Elon Musk's twitter feed before I buy or sell ETH or BTC, and I honestly don't know a single adult who does. Quite the opposite. It was in the trillions of dollars market cap when he began flirting with us all, and just as we didn't really need people Brock Pierce, Roger Ver, etc to be advocates of ""the technology"" in the past...  because the blockchain's economic benefits are eventually self-evident to its users. (Some would argue Bitcoin would have been actually better off without such controversial advocates centralizing the locus of influence.)

So, to answer red herring 1: the vast, vast majority of us aren't here because of Elon Musk, nor because of Suze Orman, Robert Kiyosaki, William Shatner or any of the other fine folks who have caught the bug. Instead, these celebrities are laymen late adopters to our technology, and they're getting some things very wrong in how they present our technology to the wider public, in my view at least.

Red Herring 2: ""The government should prevent this from happening!""

Prevent what, exactly, from happening? Crypto markets have gone from $0 to more than $2 trillion of market value, because of the use cases. These are voluntary, consensual markets. The people who have made the lion's share from crypto's rise *aren't* Elon Musk types, but all of us. Millions of people were lifted up by ETH and BTC, many don't discuss this for tax reasons, privacy, etc. 

Due to this disclosure bias, on social media and places like reddit we typically only hear from people who did unusually poorly - the person who sold their house for a useless NFT, etc. 

Red Herring 3: ""I just don't want you using money that isn't a rectangle of paper with a dead slaveholder's face on it, majority controlled by a handful of families!!!!!! You're shaking my loosely held assumptions about the world to the core and I don't like it!""

It's hard for me to downshift the gears of my mind to such a place where I can discern what exactly is driving all these knuckle dragging anti-crypto posts over the last couple days, and it's not exactly jealousy - it's literally some kind of lack of understanding of what crypto is, and a lack of insight into what is driving the vast majority of us here. It ain't greed.

When people ask me why am I in crypto, and in ETH specifically, I turn it around and ask them why are they in fiat? It's owned by a handful of families, there's no fiat that has ever survived the test of time, and it's foundationally unfair to trade one's skills for money which has been pre-mined by humans back in the 1910s or whatever, and then pretty much bagheld generationally. Even worse, there's no proof-of-stake or proof-of-work component to these historically bagheld USDs or EURs, so we're all scrambling for money that was invented effortlessly by others, yet that we need to sacrifice labor, time, or originality in exchange for. That's the essence of servitude.

So, when someone is hyperventilating about Elon Musk manipulating the market, or is worried that crypto ransoms will shatter the West because that's what they hear on Fiat Media all day long, get them to realize their money is missing a feature that millions of us take for granted: proof-of-work, proof-of-stake.

Contrary to Fiat Media and what some celebrities say, there's no free lunch in crypto. Proof of one's ownership, or past work in maintaining the chain, is what makes us the new money. We're all risking our legacy money - fiat USDs or EURs etc. - or our mining rigs to nurture the chains we want to maintain and build our projects on. The ""boom"" some are seeing is simply the Reward part of the Risk/Reward equation.

Nothing was taken from another, and the rise in crypto isn't even a victimless crime. It's not a crime at all. 

As I [wrote](https://www.theilluminist.net/blog/what-to-make-of-elon-musks-betrayal-of-bitcoin) recently on my personal blog, Elon Musk's about face on crypto is a true betrayal, but we can use it to educate and on-board the next 100 million crypto users, instead of allowing it to be the latest Weaponized Narrative against the blockchain.",1621259065,DavidSeamanAMA,True,1,11,2021-05-17

I run a local Bitcoin meetup and lately a lot of people are interested in NFTs.

I am sceptical of them because as  I see it, you are not really buying artwork. You are just buying a token with a link to a centralised server hosting an artwork. 

Owning the token does not give you any special rights.

This is a fun and good analogy.

I posted this question on the Bitcoin reddit and got a good explanation of NFTs and why they are worthless and of no long term value.

ethereum,How does PoS not artificially inflate price?,"Before you aim your downvote cannons at me know that I'm long on eth and ada. I can't help but feel that PoS helps drive price artificially while not offering any benefit beyond PoW besides the environmental concerns of mining. **I'm looking to have my opinion changed not to shit on PoS.**

In order to secure the network you must buy and not sell. In fact there is great incentive to keep buying and never sell because the more you stake the more you make. The more buying that occurs, without equivalent selling, the more the price goes up. Eventually you could get to a point where liquidity dries up and the price is sky high because everyone has their coins staked. Once big exchanges like coinbase allow the average user to stake the amount staked will skyrocket and I can't see how that doesn't drive the price way up. The price should go up because the coins become more desirable for reasons other than the potential acquiring more coins and ultimately more money in your pocket. The utility should be driving demand and ultimately price.

With PoW the miners just mine whatever is the most profitable. They don't help generate demand for the coins. When demand for the coins go up miners point more of their resources at those coins. This independence feels better to me because if everyone decides that PoW coins are worthless one day then the sell side goes way up which drives the price down and miners go out of business.

ethereum,Blockchain Gaming - The rise of the Metaverse economy on the Ethereum blockchain,"Metaverse is on the rise. The economic &amp; social implications of open, inclusive &amp; self-sovereign digital worlds are hard to overstate. For those reasons alone, metaverse is the future.

But there‚Äôs another story here. In fact, metaverse is not a luxury, it‚Äôs a necessity

Over the recent decades, the degree of freedom we have as individuals in the physical world has been declining. This includes freedom in a physical sense as overpopulation and urban migration make our cities less and less livable.

In 1950, only 2 cities had a population of more than 10m. By 2025-2030, an estimated 630 million people will live in ~40 megacities. This leads to inadequate infrastructure, slums, sanitation and healthcare problems. Among other things.

Our degree of freedom is also restricted through rules and regulations. You probably noticed that there are more and more of those. Who wouldn‚Äôt want to escape into the metaverse when you are increasingly told how to live your life in the real world.

Now let‚Äôs talk about the environment. Climate change is real. We are slowly destroying the world we live in. The Earth is becoming less and less habitable. At the same time, there are physical limits to our ability to avoid the consequences.

Our efforts to address climate change have, so far, been inadequate. Vested interests, inability to sacrifice now for the benefit later, etc are some of the reasons. We don‚Äôt know if we can fix this, but the signs are not good.

So, we are losing our freedom in the real world and, at the same time, the world is becoming harder to live in. This is why metaverse is the future. Unlimited degree of freedom. Unlimited space and possibilities. Plus better economic and social construct.

As it is always weird to send my ethers to other people and because of the fear of validators slashing, I'm being hesitant to put my money there.

But then again it has to be done at some point as I don't see myself paying 100$ for a TX and yet onboarding onto L2 looks like it might that expensive since I would have to move all my assets into one wallet first and then pay for the L2 contract gas.

Crypto is sent and held in some type of decentralized escrow service. Seller ships item to buyer. Buyer tries to cheat the system by saying the  item was never received (even though it was). The funds in the escrow gets returned to the buyer. Buyer now has original crypto and item. 

Since the physical item itself cannot also be placed on the blockchain and exists in the imperfect, real world, how can this be validated and insured? How is it kept in sync with the digital ledger?",1621136850,TDN-ThickDickNick,True,1,8,2021-05-16

ethereum,Viability of dApps... is there any hope?,"Hi guys,

This post is mainly asking advice and wondering about how to approach my current situation.

I've scratched the surface of etheruem and was convinced that this is an amazing new innovation that I wanted to add to my personal iOS app with over 3600+ users. I have a basic business model that will both benefit users and 3rd party vendors on the app. Basically, I want to be paying users with my own ERC20 token while vendors will be purchasing ""ad space"" specific to my application with the only payment method being my ERC20 token.

I researched everything and was able to get a ""proven"" model up and running. Today, I was supposed to implement the beta version of this ERC20 token into my application.

Then, I ran into a big wall. I never thought about gas fees.

My use case involves auto-transferring ERC20 tokens to users just for using the app (get paid to view ads... looking at you Facebook). But each of these transactions that I was planning for my backend to initiate would cost me currently about $5.00 each with is absolutely ridiculous, considering the amount of user activity that would be in my app.

I was wondering if there was an alternative or different solution to this problem? Or am I really under the mercy of Ethereum developers?

I really want this to work and for my application to be a part of Ethereum, but I cannot justify paying $5.00 per user activity on my app (thousands of activities a day...).

Thank you for your advice!",1621133651,henryo84,True,1,12,2021-05-16

We all had high hopes when Elon entered the game back in February, thinking he would bring institutional adoption and bring legitimacy to the space. Instead he did the exact opposite and basically turned crypto into a total joke with Dogecoin. It‚Äôs just shits and giggles for him to prove he‚Äôs so powerful he can take a meme coin and people will buy it. It‚Äôs all just a power trip to soothe his megalomaniac ego. 

You talk to friends and colleagues to explain ethereum to them now and they‚Äôre just like ‚Äúhey what about doggy coins?‚Äù.

Is just me that have a feeling that I'm paying almost 50% pool fee??
let me explain... so when difficulty was 7,5 p I was mining 0,005 eth/day with my rtx 3080... with the price increase of ETH ot was like 20$/day (remember to see a day that was 30$/day)...
now difficulty has been on 7,8 - 8P and rewards is around 0,003 ETH/day...
difficulty didn't dobled...
isn't that weird that no matter the value of the coins the rewards are always aroubd 10$/day (rtx 3080) ?? 
sure.. price increase ans people move the rigs for thst coin.. but we don't see any big decrease in difficulty in other coins...

ethereum,Central Bank attack on PoS vs. PoW,"Dear all,

there is a scenario in my head that made me post to discuss further. **It is highly appreciated if the bold questions can be discussed/answered.**

Assumptions:

* A central bank wants or a group of coordinated central banks want to attack a cryptocurrency network in order to establish rules, for instance banning specific adresses from participating in the network.
* In order to achieve that, the central bank or group of central banks operate without communicating this to the public (for obvious reasons).
* The attack doesn't aim to destroy the network. Reason why: For both PoS or PoW networks, the attacker(s) can just gain majority of stakes or computing power and destroy the network. Obviously, the crypto-community would react (forking, other networks, and so on...).
* But the attacker has one specific aim: Enforcing rules in the system that the attacker endorses.

**Now the big question is: Is PoW better suited to protect from this attack or PoS (by PoW I especially mean Bitcoin)? From my limited understanding it is PoW.**

The point I want to make clear is that under a PoW regime, the attacker would need a lot of funds to maintian at least 51% computing power in the network, making this attempt a nightmare from the viewpoint of the attacker. That is a big advantage of heavy-energy usage to secure the PoW network (I am pointing out to Bitcoin especially). But on the other hand, in a PoS network, the attacker 'just' needs to gain a majority stake and change the rules. If that situation is reached, there is no need for additional effort that needs to be put into the network by the attacker. I see this as a great danger, as the ideal of a cryptocurrency is to free the world from the weapon of mass destruction called *central banking*. Of course, by doing network analysis, the community can detect a possible attacker on the PoS network (paired with data gained from exchanges, as this attack attempt would lead to price and probably volume distortions). And in order to ban some adresses, it must be known whom they belong to (let us assume this is a given).

**How can a PoS network defend against that by design? Has this been considered by the Ethereum protocol or any other PoS protocol so far?** In my opinion, this is a crucial issue if a crypto-network wants to become a world currency.

My ideas so far, please correct me if they are wrong:

* Introducing an anonymous Blockchain, where it cannot be traced where funds are sent to. Of course this would make a network analysis on the Chain impossible, but the exchange data would still be available as this would give a lot of hints of such an attack attempt. And even if the majority stake is in the hands of the attacker(s): Who do they want to ban and how?
* Introducing a *constitution* with rules as the impossibility of censoring/blocking adresses and so on with automatic mechanisms to kick out anyone who wants to ban someone else. **Is this even possible? As long as someone has the majority (stake or computing power), ANY rules can be changed, correct?**",1621092446,UpperOrdinary,True,1,90,2021-05-15

ethereum,Rewriting transaction history in POS?,"In a POW chain, it requires a lot of computing power and time to re-write the whole blockchain history.

But in POS, it doesn't. It wouldn't be hard to fake all the block producing processes and timestamps and thus all the transaction history to make a 'real' chain like the original chain.

For this issue, there seems to be 'checkpoints'. However, for new network participants, a trusted third party could be required to provide them authentic checkpoint data. Are these third parties used in Ethereum? How are they selected?

Also, between checkpoints, it seems someone could make up a chain (with fake RANDAO processes) where all the cheating addresses are to produce blocks. How is this prevented?",1621091391,fkpolimods,True,1,25,2021-05-15

ethereum,Details regarding how the RNG works for POS?,"Hello, could someone point to a guide/post/video regarding the details of how the RNG works for POS currently?

I saw some old videos where about the process, where the participants commit a hash of a number and later disclose the number used to create the has. Later on, all the numbers are used as seeds for the RNG. However, in this case, the people observing the chain could choose to not disclose the numbers to maximize their chance of making more future blocks, also, as the numbers propagate through the distributed network, someone in the network could choose to censor the number information. Also, how is the deadline to disclose the numbers programmed?

There are some later articles talking about RANDAO + VDF, however, in this case, who are calculating the VDFs? If it's the same people who submit the VDF seeds, they could just choose to not submit the results of the VDFs to cheat. Also, machines calculate the VDFs in different speeds (20x or more), and someone looking at the seeds others submit for VDFs could use parallel computing to calculate multiple VDFs at once. How does this thing work really? And what's the deadline to submit VDF results?",1621088792,fkpolimods,True,1,0,2021-05-15

I think I‚Äôve lost/misplaced a small amount of ether and I thought I‚Äôd ask the community if there was any way to find it.  Probably not, but can‚Äôt hurt to ask. 

Back in 2018, I was playing with small amounts of some crypto and had purchased about 0.41 Ether on Coinbase. (1/29/18 per Coinbase transaction history). Shortly thereafter, I sent that 0.41 Ether somewhere. I have the transaction details including the transaction hash and the address of where it was sent. But I can‚Äôt seem to figure out where exactly I sent it. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be in my Ledger Nano (where I put most things) but it‚Äôs also not sitting on any exchange that I was using at the time (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp).

So ‚Äî armed only with the trans hash and the recipient address, is there any way to know where I sent this Ether?  I‚Äôm presuming it‚Äôs lost, and I know it‚Äôs not a big chunk of chain, but I‚Äôd love to find/recover it if possible.

ethereum,"Since the beginning of 2021, DeFi protocols have suffered up to $156 million in losses from attacks.","The attacks targeting the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry caused $156 million in losses, while the total loss of the entire crypto market, according to blockchain data analytics firm CipherTrace is $432 million.

This amount of damage is higher than the total loss from attacks on the DeFi protocol for all of 2020. The $156 million figure doesn't even include ""DeFi-related"" scams (DeFi- related fraud) worth $83.4 million.

DeFi is a decentralized industry with a focus on protocols using blockchain technology. Transactions are completely processed by smart contracts instead of a traditional bank or an investment management unit, and thus will ensure fairness and transparency for all participants.

The problem, however, is that smart contracts still have to be created by developers: the risk on the part of hackers is great, but if developers create a system of protocols that allows them to secretly withdraw funds at will, what about secret? It can be said that DeFi is inherently a form of high-risk investment, even in an inherently risky financial ecosystem.

According to data from DeFi Pulse, TVL in DeFi is now $85 billion compared to $16 billion on January 1, 2021.

I understand that Vechain is mainly a supply chain focused blockchain and they have a lot of projects being developed but I dont think any of them are finalized and working yet however it seems at least some of these supply chain projects will use Vechain ""public"" blockchain (therefore VET or VTHO tokens would be used).

ethereum,OMGX Optimistic Rollups will help scale Ethereum,"Hear me out. We all know the history of OMG from 2017, but about five months ago, a miracle happened. The team was acquired by GBV, a HK VC firm, and is currently being led by [Enya.ai](https://enya.ai/), which is comprised of Alan Chiu and Jan Liphardt. Alan is the Co-President of Stanford's Alumni Association for Entrepreneurs, and Jan is a Professor at Stanford. Big Brains.

Admittingly, although it can achieve high TPS and is relatively cheap, OMG Plasma is not EVM compatible.

**OMGX - Optimistic Rollups**

So the team launched the Testnet of OMGX, its ETH L2 Solution based on Optimistic Rollups. It is essentially Optimism with added features - primarily crosschain bridging / fast exits and a staking token.

Read more: [https://docs.omgx.network/faq](https://docs.omgx.network/faq)

If you don't already know what Optimistic Rollups are, it scales Ethereum throughput by about 100-150x, is cheaper, and relies on Ethereum's security (unlike sidechains, \*cough\* i.e. Matic). It is a true Layer 2 solution.

If you are tired of high gas prices, this is basically the best thing since sliced bread.

You can also read about Rollups here by Vitalik: [https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html)

**Staking Token**

Some of us have complained that one of the Layer 2 solutions that Vitalik is pushing for does not have a token. Optimism and Arbitrum, which have been building Optimistic Rollups, are privately funded and do not have a token. This absolutely sucks for average Joes like us who can't get a piece of the action. The rich just get richer. This is not the crypto way.

Well, now is your chance! OMG will be the staking token for OMGX and will power the network. All 140 million tokens are currently in circulation (max capped, no shenanigans), and traded on almost any exchange. (Not financial advice, DYOR)

**Crosschain Bridging / Fast Exits (Quasar)**

OMGX also has something else Optimism and Arbitrum do not have - Fast Exits. Typically, Optimistic Rollups have a 7-day exit period. Long exit periods can pretty much cripple Layer 2 usage.

The OMG team has solved this with Quasar fast exits. It is a swap based mechanism to move across chains - L1/L2 or L2/L2 - for a small fee that is paid to liquidity providers.

This means you will be able to move assets from ETH to OMGX to OMG Plasma almost instantaneously. The idea is to connect the three with Quasar fast exits, making Layer 2 easy to use depending on your needs. OMG Plasma for high TPS and cheap simple transactions. OMGX for smart contracts.

Vitalik actually did a proposal on this very idea recently: [https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-rollup-dex-with-smart-contracts-only-on-the-destination-side/8778](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-rollup-dex-with-smart-contracts-only-on-the-destination-side/8778)

Not to take anything away from Vitalik (Sorry!), but guess what? The OMG team was already working on it and finished coding it! Quasar fast exit contracts are currently in audit, and will be done by the end of May.

\*Optimism has a solution to allow fast exits of Dai only.

**Who is going to build on OMGX?** Well, everyone! It would be foolish not to build on it. Because the construction is so similar to ETH, it takes less than an hour to port code from ETH or BSC to OMGX.

Here is an example of Sushiswap being ported:

[https://docs.omgx.network/developer-docs/case-studies/porting-sushi-omgx](https://docs.omgx.network/developer-docs/case-studies/porting-sushi-omgx)

There is literally no downside to porting an existing Dapp on to OMGX. Uniswap is slated to launch on Optimism, but it would take almost no effort to add it to OMGX as well. More exposure and choices for Dapps is a win-win for the community!

For developers out there: [https://www.omgx.network/apply/](https://www.omgx.network/apply/)

**Is OMGX late to the party?** Nope, here are the current issues with Layer 2 solutions:

Plasma (i.e. OMG Plasma) - Not EVM compatible

ZK Rollups (i.e. ZKsync, Starkware) - Not EVM compatible currently

Side chains (i.e. Matic, xDai) - Not secured by ETH, not a Layer 2 solution!

Optimistic Rollups (i.e. Optimism, Arbitrum, OMGX) - Not live

As you can see, the race to scale Ethereum hasn't even started, and there is room for more than one solution.

The OMG team has moved at ~~Lightning~~ Plasma speed in only the last five months since its acquisition. I would not be surprised if OMGX Mainnet is launched in the next month or two.

ethereum,Can we run out of gas?,"Arthur Haynes said this in his latest article about EIP 1559 potentially decreasing ETH‚Äôs supply. What do you think?

‚ÄúIf the amount of gas fees exponentially increases alongside usage, and these fees are burned, then very quickly the inflation schedule will become deflationary. The supply of Ether will decline in Ether terms as the platform becomes more useful. If we are underestimating the impact of DeFi on human economic interactions, there is a future where there isn‚Äôt enough Ether supply to allow the system to function.

The retort to that is that an extremely high price of ETH solves that supply issue. But it does not, there is no magic ETH in the ground that can be exploited if the marginal mining profits expand enough. The network will not produce enough ETH, via block rewards, to satisfy its use in the attainment of the Ethereum mission.

At this point, the network‚Äôs economics fails. The price is high, and HODLers are popping Ace of Spades, but it‚Äôs a short walk to the poor house if the DeFi apps that require fuel cannot obtain it at ANY COST. Given what we know about how the community responds to existential threats to accomplishing its mission (see: the DAO hack), do you expect them to sit by and watch the network kill itself due to a flawed inflation schedule? If you hard-forked once, you can hard-fork again. The deflationary issuance and gas burn schedule will be sacrificed so that Dapps can be used at the volumes necessary to power the decentralised computer.‚Äù
