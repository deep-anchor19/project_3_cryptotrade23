I feel that Musk‚Äôs statement at the meeting may have a consequence that needs to be paid attention to. He took Tesla and spacex‚Äôs corporate funds and personal assets to allocate a large amount of BTC and did not complete the sell-off at a high level. (Except for the part in the previous announcement), and the cost is about the same as it is now, and Musk said that he will not sell it now, and he may buy it if it continues to fall.

Bitcoin,Another scam the scammer story.,"I saw how much you guys enjoyed [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/oolqdb/today_i_was_able_to_scam_the_scammer_lol/), so thought I'd share my experience of getting a scammer to send me a $27 ""token gift"" several months ago.  


Full story: [https://imgur.com/a/zYjdjdC](https://imgur.com/a/zYjdjdC)  


**Summary:** The scammer is impersonating ""The Bitcoin Rabbi"" but replaces the ""i"" in Rabbi with a ""j."" He supposedly can give you 10x on your investment in 5 days if you join his trading/investment company. I used the ""inspect element"" tool in the browser to create fake screenshots of ""my bitcoin wallet"" to make him believe that I had several bitcoin. I then used the same technique to create a fake conversation between me and another ""investment"" company. I got him to believe this other company offered a ""token gift"" to new investors as a sign of trust. I eventually get the scammer to compete with this other fake company and send me a $27 ""token gift.""

The scammers twitter handle is one letter off from the real Bitcoin Rabbi. The scammer replaced the ""i"" with a ""j"" so after receiving the token gift, I began replacing all ""i' with ""j"" until he figured out what was going. Since he is a Rabbi I also question him about the 7th commandment, ""Thou shall not steal.""",1626924954,grnqrtr,True,1,16,2021-07-22

Bitcoin,How to Invest $1000 Dollars in Crypto? Just Turned 18.,"Hey Bitcoin community, 

As you can gather from the title, I just turned 18 and have accumulated a decent sum of money throughout my years of summer jobs and birthdays. I've been interested in crypto, more specifically Bitcoin, for a few years now. 

I have the fundamental knowledge of crypto but am looking to learn more. My question was concerning what recommendations you all had on how to invest $1000 into various cryptocurrencies? I was thinking about investing half into Bitcoin and the rest into a few other currencies.  I'm not sure how far $1000 can get you in the realm of crypto, but for the moment I believe this is a good starting point. ( Or not?) I am willing to invest more money after I  have a better understanding of crypto. 

Before I close off, what would you guys say is the best crypto exchange for beginner use?

Also, I apologize if this was the wrong place to ask these questions.

Bitcoin,Shower thought I had about a potential source of energy for Bitcoin mining.,"So basically my idea will combine things I watched in 2 separate videos. 

You may want to watch them as well, so you can get what I'm talking about here. It's about 6 minutes of watch time.

English isn't my first language so I may not be able to explain my ideas as clearly as I would like to.

Anyways:

First, I watched this video.

Billions In Change Official Film
https://youtu.be/aqxlWeoa53s

Watch from 14:10 - 18:49


Then I watched this video

The Deepest Hole in the World, And What We've Learned From It

Watch from 2:25 - 2:51


So to summarize. The first video talks about sending Graphene cables down into the earth to be able to extract heat from below  the Earth's surface.

The second video talks about the deepest hole on Earth that goes down 12 km and it gets so hot that they couldn't dig any further because the rocks began to ""act like plastic"".

So there may not even be a need to dig a new hole for energy when one already exists. 

I think Mining companies and Bitcoin billionaires have enough money and resources to explore this idea. 

Manufacturing 12km long graphene cables might be costly but it's a one time expense.

 I think if it can successfully mine Bitcoin profitably over the long term then it does give them the incentive to try it.

I don't have a science or engineering background so this may just be a pipe dream and I'm sure someone more knowledgeable will totally debunk this idea.",1626911932,regretfulfor,True,1,9,2021-07-22

Bitcoin,"With current FUD, don't panic sell. Bitcoin's value will still go to infinity on the long term. Here is why.","During these times, I see a lot of FUD around and newbies are converting their sats back into USD because they fear to lose it all. That‚Äôs unfortunate.

What are the reasons of this sell-off? They treat Bitcoin like risky stocks, get rich quick scheme or worst, they don‚Äôt understand how basic economy works They have no idea that Bitcoin changes everything and will transform our entire society for the better.

As a result, I wanted to emphasize once again why our world needs Bitcoin and reassure everyone that its value is scheduled to go to infinity on the long term.

# 1) We will always want to have more than our neighbors

Since the early ages, humans have always lived in societies to survive and evolve. Social mechanisms have bring the dominance question into the equation: in order to establish our status among our society, we want to have more money than others to show dominance.

Not so long ago, some guys found a new way to distinguish themselves from the masses even more. Their idea was to privately own businesses and make people work for them so they can keep all the profits. It is called capitalism and is still considered the best system nowadays.

# 2) Inflation makes rich richer, while making poor poorer

An interesting lever for our elites to keep earning more is infinite growth. One way to do it is to let banks print new money which will be injected into the economy. Businesses will produce more, people will have more money, making owners wealthier.

However, the more money is printed to support growth, the bigger the money supply gets, and the more prices of goods and services go up. This is inflation. As wages don‚Äôt increase at the same level, employees get less buying power over time, making them poorer.

# 3) Deflation system will never be voted by elites

Remember, governments and business owners will always want to save their privileged status. Stopping money printing, would result in deflation, which means that prices would go down and people stop buying. Why buying something today when it will be cheaper tomorrow?

At that point, companies would go bankrupt, and shareholders would lose their wealth. You know understand how this is important for them to keep inflation running. Quite easy to do : banks simply have to lower loans APR to encourage people to take credits and buy stuffs.

# 4) Inflationary system has plenty of other negative effects

Inflation is also an endless nightmare. Banks or countries borrows money from central banks but their debts will never be paid back. Instead, they take new debts to reimburse part of the old debts. Money printer will never stop. This is actually getting worst over time.

Last but not least, inflation is not a sustainable system for our finite planet. Always-increasing mass consumerism consumes always more energy and resources that are not abundant. Global warming and climate change will never slow down by itself in an inflationist economy.

# 5) Be your own bank with Bitcoin and change the system

To make things clear from the start, Bitcoin is our only hope to change the system. You don‚Äôt know who to vote for at the next elections because you don‚Äôt trust them to bring a working solution? Just buy Bitcoin and hold it. This will be your best vote to have a real impact.

Here are the 5 main reasons why Bitcoin is the only viable solution :

a) Bitcoin is decentralized: it is not governed by anyone and has been designed to follow the exact same principles and will continue to deliver as promised forever. Algorithms embraces certainty. It is the opposite of human-based government that can change rules every now and then to please their own bank account.

b) Bitcoin has a 21M max supply: this is the first time in history we are dealing with an asset that will always be absolutely finite (not even gold), and cannot be replicated. Less and less coin will be produced until 2140, making it the perfect deflationary asset, without mentioning coins that will be lost forever. It is the opposite of central banks which are printing infinite FIAT currencies.

c) Bitcoin is the most secured asset: billions of successful transactions to date and millions of wallets without a single hack to date. The more people join, the more the network is strong and secured. Bitcoin is your secured property as opposed at current systems where banks are hacked every day and could collapse or take your gold in absolute necessity.

d) Bitcoin is the most liquid asset: you are always 1 click away to send any amount to anyone, at any time, and anywhere in the world. Everyone can be its own bank without any government intervention or third party censorship.

e) Bitcoin is the perfect ledger: blockchain technology keeps perfect track of every transaction that has ever happened. You would rather buy your drugs with cash than buying them with Bitcoin. Same principle with corrupted governments in a lot of third countries.

# 6) Bitcoin is a store of value asset above all

As you have probably noticed, and despite what is written on the Bitcoin white paper, I want you to treat Bitcoin like an store of value asset first. The currency/cash feature is just the cherry on top the cake that Satoshi offered to us.

However, as each Bitcoin transaction is considered  a taxable event in many countries, this does not advocate for a currency usage. The high transaction fees are also a challenge that will need to be adressed. There are layer-2 solutions like lightning network that will help in that matter.

# 7) Bitcoin is incentiving holders to think long term

Bitcoin being deflationary, it encourages people to hold their sats on the long term. Nobody wants to sell their bitcoins into a weaker currency that is losing more value over time. Never compare the price of 1 BTC to USD, this is pointless as USD price will go to infinity because of infinite money printing. This is why 1 BTC will always be equal to 1 BTC.

To judge Bitcoin‚Äôs value, think instead on its USD market capitalization and compare it to other scarce asset market caps. Bitcoin still has room to grow 10x its current price to have the same value of gold. 100x to have the same of real estate. If you consider that Bitcoin is scarcer, more secured, and more liquid than these 2 assets, I let you imagine how early we still are.

I hope this summary will help people to realize how important Bitcoin is for our future. It is our escape gate to a fair, inclusive and sustainable world. Buy, hold and spread the word around you!

The market did in fact panic, but I hypothesize that the initial shock was artificially created by a bunch of whales dumping coins into the market to benefit from said shock and buy up later at much lower prices (thus explaining the initial dump right before the crash).

I blame whales for many of the problems and flaws in the crypto market. Without them a lot of ‚Äúprice corrections‚Äù would go out of control as we currently see along with many other problems that would simply disappear or at least be mitigated.

The only good thing we got out of this market crash is that some companies finally started taking care of the whale wallet problem.

Bitcoin,"Elon misunderstands energy use, block size, and block time for Bitcoin. The B Word response.","Elon, the energy cost from bitcoin mining is proportional to its monetary value. Mining is a competition where each participant is incentivized to spend as much money on equipment and electricity as it is profitable. This market will exist for any truly decentralized cryptocurrency. Other cryptos cost less to mine right now because they are worth less, not because they provide more transactions per block. Bitcoin started with just one computer in 2008, using a CPU to process blocks. It could scale back down to that size one day if people stopped valuing it and discontinued mining. The majority of energy used to mine is not spent on processing and recording transactions, it is spent on ‚Äúrolling dice‚Äù for a chance to be the winner of each block and receive the associated transaction fees and block reward. Elon, your affinity for other cryptos with increased block size and block time may be functional for some nodes who have access to gigabyte Ethernet and abundant hard drive space, but that‚Äôs not scalable globally right now. People in many countries cannot afford multiple terabyte hard drives to store the entire blockchain. Currently, Bitcoin requires less than one Terabyte, and that‚Äôs after 10 years of use. The risk of such a change, to faster block times and larger block size is that we could see a choke point emerge with cloud hosting becoming the only way to support and participate in a larger blockchain network, as is the case for E, which relies on Amazon Web Services running Infura. E is not decentralized and will become increasingly political with proof of stake, if they are able to make that transition. The point of bitcoin is to overcome human systems that can be influenced by majority stakeholders, lobbyists, or law makers. Bitcoin is a responsive system that scales up and down, seeking out stranded energy, providing a new way to use excess energy globally.

Bitcoin,"How can we, as a community, reduce the energy consumption of Bitcoin?","I mean, we know, proof of work works very reliable and we are afraid of testing out something different that might endanger the network. But in the end, we use an enormous amount of energy, which no one ever thought was possible.

We have so many brilliant minds in our community. I think we must invent something better that works as reliable as proof of work and is fair (not like proof of stake, where the rich get richer).

Maybe, we can use some hybrid models in the transition phase to not totally loose control when one system fails.

What are the current plans for the future of Bitcoin in terms of energy consumption?

Unfortunately, this is nowadays a very strong counter argument against Bitcoin, which sadly blanks out all the other important properties in nearly every Bitcoin discussion.

Now that obviously wasn‚Äôt me, nor did I authorize anybody to reset my password. I tried to log in with my old password which didn‚Äôt work, so I filled out the forgot my password form and expected an email back with the link to reset my password, but it never came. Tried again a few times but never any email back from Coinbase letting ME reset my email, tho the password was changed from somewhere else this morning. So I further went on to lock my account via phone call, all that needed was that I was calling from the phone number associated with my Coinbase account. I have 2FA set up for my Coinbase account. My question here is, with 2FA set up, if somebody did successfully change my password and try to log in, wouldn‚Äôt it ask for my 2FA,? but since they already got as far as resetting my Coinbase password do they have any shot at having access to my 2FA too,? Or is the 2FA strictly only on my phone.

My only aim was making a quick return so I could buy those lambos!! 

However, once the price peaked out and started to drop and the value of my holding when down and down, in fiat terms. I didn't sell and instead just chose to forget about the investment altogether. A few months later a video about BTC popped up on my recommended youtbe feed. I then remembered that I had some BTC and decided to watch the video. Can't remeber what the video was about specificially but it was interesting enough to make me want to research more about the topic. 

Over the next few weeks and months I then researched as much as I could about BTC, how it worked, what its uses were etc. I also became increasing concerned about the exteremly loose fiscal and monetary policy employeed by western governments and central banks. These two reasons convinced me that I needed to get some more BTC in order to help prepare myself for the future.

I didn't do any crazy trading stragegies or YOLOs, instead I started dollar cost averaging into BTC from early 2019 onwards, not large amounts since I was at university and didn't have much money but as much as I could spare each month. Since then the price has had its ups and downs and occasionally I fall into the habit of thinking in hindsight that I should have bought more there or sold out there but in general I have stopped paying attention to the price and instead focused on getting enough fiat to continue buying BTC!

I think what people can learn from my story is that it doesn't matter when you hear about BTC but how you approach it after you do. Once you do your research on the topic it really does open your eyes to a whole new way of thinking about money, the global economy and of course personal freedom. So to everyone reading this keep on stacking BTC and focus on yourself not the price flucuations!!",1626883482,CoinCollector567,True,1,1,2021-07-22

Bitcoin,BlockFi Rewards Credit Card,"I was just approved for the card and should receive it in a week's time. 

My understanding is that instead of Bitcoin, I will receive 1.5x points per $1 spent the card but that's it is actually rewarded in ""BlockFi Cryptocurrency Rewards Points."" Once the points are deposited into my BlockFi account, it then gets converted into bitcoin.

My question is: How does BlockFi determine how much Bitcoin is actually received? Since it's still being converted from $1 spent to rewards and then into Bitcoin, what is their determination of Bitcoin reward?

Example: $10,000 spent = 150 BlockFi Cryptocurrency Rewards Points = ??? Bitcoin

If the 150 Rewards Points = $150, then that amount of Bitcoin rewards could vary depending on the time it's rewarded to me and price of Bitcoin at that time. 

Surely BlockFi isn't going to be evaluating the time of each purchase on the credit card and correlate it to the price of BTC at that point in time to adjust the rewards accordingly?

I was asking me this because I saw that in the last days btc dropped really fast and now the price went really fast back to almost the same amount that it was worth when it dropped, why does that happen is this because of the ""Infinite Money Glitch""?

Truly amazing to see that Apr 09, 2017 was the worst day for a 4 year HODL'er to sell, as Bitcoin purchased on Apr 09, 2013 is only worth a little over 5 times what it was purchased for !

Remember that nasty red candle yesterday ?

If you'd sold yesterday (Jul 20, 2021) Bitcoin you'd bought 4 years previously on Jul 20, 2017 you'd have a fiat value a little over 10 times your purchase price.

Bitcoin,Visualizing Bitcoin Lightning Network growth and Taproot upgrade explained,"What is Lightning Network? (ELI5)

Lightning Network is a decentralized layer-2 network protocol that uses a native smart contract scripting language to enable instant, almost feeless Bitcoin payments.

On the Lightning Network, both parties to a transaction are required only to have a sufficiently funded open channel on the network. This is done through a single on-chain transaction.

If there is a direct channel open between the parties, the transaction is routed directly and incurs zero fees. Without a direct channel, the transaction is routed through routing nodes.

Whan a transaction passes through a routing node, it is referred to as a ""hop"". There are currently 23k nodes on the Lightning Network with 13k nodes having active channels.

Three years ago, Lightning Network was admittedly far from ideal.

*Processing img h9ll0z9rwkc71...*

But the network has seen exponential growth since, particularly this year. Lightning Network is now nigh-on a fully functional global payments network secured by the Bitcoin blockchain. Lightning wallets have also come a long way and are now very intuitive to use for the average user.

*Processing img 1auw5sjvwkc71...*

Network capacity has doubled this year. Likewise, nodes and channels have grown exponentially,  reducing the number of hops, channel lifespan and fee incurred for hops through routing nodes.

*Processing img cow6o2aywkc71...*

The growth of the Lightning Network has inspired some pretty cool developments this year,

Following the success of the Bitcoin beach project, a pilot for Lightning Network's viability as MoE, El Salvador has adopted Bitcoin on the LN as legal tender.

Other countries like Tonga, Colombia and a few other LatAm countries have expressed interest to follow suit.

Twitter will launch a tipping system on its platform later this year using the Lightning Network.

*Processing img gd1odw5qxkc71...*

**Taproot**

Now with Lightning Network's maturation as an instant, almost feeless, infinitely scalable decentralized global payments network, Bitcoin is shifting focus to its next big milestone, Taproot.

Taproot brings a set of protocols that further enhance Bitcoin's scalability through even more efficient use of block space by introducing a new type of output - Pay to Taproot (P2TR).

P2TR uses Schnorr signatures, which are more compact than the conventional Elliptic Curve Digital Signing Algorithm (ECDSA) signatures. Schnorr signatures are between 6 and 9 bytes shorter than ECDSA.

An even more exciting aspect of Schnorr signatures is that it enables the aggregation of multiple signatures into a single signature. This opens up infinite possibilities, including being able to execute multi-sigs and L2/sidechain smart contracts as a simple regular transaction on-chain.

It's a truly game-changing development, as it allows Bitcoin to have smart contract protocols without bloating the blockchain layer.

Taproot also includes optimization for the Lightning Network called Point Time-Locked Contract(PTLC). PTLC replaced Hash Time-Locked Contract(HTLC). PTLC uses adaptor signatures which enhance privacy and security on the Lightning Network, enable escrow contracts in Lightning channels and allow users to retry stuck payments.
