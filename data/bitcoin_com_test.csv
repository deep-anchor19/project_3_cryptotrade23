but yes, I sitill 100% stand by the names I posted earlier (as a few, but not all) of the globalists who have more actual power than any of our ""elected"" leaders.

I mean, look at obedient blob Angela Merkel, do you really think she got elected due to charm or talent?

What about the current US president, the dude has dementia ffs.  You think more people came out for him on election day  than any candidate ever, in the history of America? (when he cant even draw a crowd of 100 people when he appears somewhere in person).

You think intellectual lightweight, pretty boy Trudeau won on his own merits? or stays in power based on his machiavellian political acumen?

Of course not. 

Not to say all elections are fake, but those who best appease the globalists/elites get to stay in power, and those who try to expose the truth, or shine a light on the deep state will have the full weight of the globalist system unleashed upon them.

Message is clear, either ""play ball"" or be taken out.

Bitcoin,"&gt;This may be incorrect 

It is.

&gt; this is an easy way to track what your actually fiat gains are vs. what you actually spent

I don't know what you're trying to say here, but it's not how capital gains are calculated. 


&gt;I spend $4,000 to buy 4 BTC. Cost basis = $4,000 out of pocket

Cost basis is $1000 per BTC.

&gt;I sell 1 BTC for $2,000. 

Capital gain on sale of 1 BTC is (proceeds from sale of 1 BTC - cost of that 1 BTC - transaction costs). For your example, $2000 - $1000 = $1000 cap gain ... taxed.

&gt; I have 3 BTC left. $4,000 - $2,000 = I'm still down $2,000 out of pocket

Sure, but ""I'm still down in my overall holdings/portfolio"" is not how cap gains are calculated.

&gt;I sell 1 BTC for $2,000. 

Again, $2000 - $1000 = $1000 cap gain ... taxed.

&gt; I have 2 BTC left. $2,000 - $2,000 = I'm at break even with cost of $0 out of pocket

Good for you, but you still owe taxes on the $2000 you gained from selling 2 BTC for a profit of $1000 each.

&gt;I sell 1 BTC for $1,000. $1,000 - $0 = $1,000 profit so I pay taxes on this gain.

No. $1000 proceeds - $1000 cost = $0 cap gain on this sale.

&gt;I still HODL 1 BTC and I never sell. I never pay any taxes on it.

No. The cost basis of that 1 BTC was $1000 when you acquired it and will remain $1000 for as long as you hold it. If you sell it for more than $1000, that's a capital gain and unless you're in a country that doesn't tax capital gains on crypto, you'll owe taxes on your profit.",1626979831,2021-07-23

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets.

https://bluewallet.io - easy to use, Open Source, Non-custodial (although I believe LN is custodial if not using own node)

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix works on Android or iOS

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - Android or iOS

https://muun.com - Muun - another non custodial LN wallet working on Android and iOS

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words safe.

Bitcoin,This is the line of thinking I have.  And 5 million sats will be a nice house in a beautiful place.  Not so much just because the price/value of BTC.  But because of the value of BTC vs. house.  I think by 2030 people will not be using houses as a store of value (as much).  This means house prices will be lower in general across the board.  Add to that a non-adjusted (for inflation) potential of $2+m per coin and all of a sudden you're picking up homes for less than .1 BTC,1626978716,2021-07-23

Bitcoin,"Can you also include how do transaction fees work when calculating this? 
You buy 1BTC for 1000$ and you send it to cold wallet paying 0.05 BTC for fees (random number for simplicity).

One month passes and you send it to exchange oaying 0.05BTC again and you sell 0.9 BTC for 2000.
You don't have any left cause 0.01 was took by transaction fees but in terms of tax office you still have it cause you did not sell it and I don't knoe how to calculate it.",1626978639,2021-07-23
Bitcoin,"Look man

The rules in Bitcoin are pretty simple
You hold your own coins, period

That's the only way to make it secure and not depend on central points of failure (because otherwise you'd depend on people that oftentimes fail and not the network itself)
That's its purpose 

HODL returns are better than any investor's

If you can't get that, then I am sorry

* Two articles shitting on CPI =/= a link to this ""true inflation"" number. Not helpful, didn't answer the question.

* And article on house prices =/= a link to ""true inflation"" unless you're saying that ""true inflation"" is literally just house prices and nothing else? If not, didn't answer the question.

* And the last link has a million things on it, I don't know which one you are trying to say is ""true inflation"" or where I can go to get the updated numbers over time for ""true inflation"".
