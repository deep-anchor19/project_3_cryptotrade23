ethereum,Should I sell bitcoin and just go all in ethereum?,"* I have like $37.5k invested total in bitcoin, and after the crash, I only have $10.8k gains. If I sold at $65k, I'd have $100k right now in cash.
* I basically bought a whole coin at around $10k, held since, gained a lot, bought more to have .5 more buying on the way up from $35-60k. My new stack got cut in half. So basically it equalized and what would have been $100k if we kept going up is now around $50k.
* I'm down a lot right now from my new stack. Should I just hodl, or sell expecting it to dip to $27k and to buy back in and have more bitcoin? Or could bitcoin surprise us, break the resistance line, go past $32.8k? Seems like $30k has been support since February.
* If I sold my btc at $48,558, and bought back in at $27k, I could have .2 more btc. If I bought back in at $25, I could have 2 whole coins. Idk what to dooo. I don't wanna hold and then be even more negative, and I'm scared if I sell, it could go back up.
* I don't wanna sell, and then wake up to find bitcoin is going back up and I end up with less bitcoin, and less fiat.
* If I sold, I wouldn't have to pay big capital gains tax (my salary is $89k) either right since my gains has came down to 10.5k instead of selling at $65k with those gains?
* What could happen to bitcoin at the end of the month, some people are thinking $27k, because of the resistance and support lines meeting (descending wedge).. or we can hope and hope tons of buying volume to break resistance back to a bull run. Help me, I'm noob, I only realized all this today. I'm very scared and about to cry.
* Should I just sell all bitcoin, and then buy ethereum instead? I could have more gains right?",1626938727,wuzzgucci,True,1,44,2021-07-22

ethereum,Ethereum Reddit Mods censoring The Laurel - The Volunteer Platform,"The Laurel is a platform for **volunteers**, being **built by volunteers**. 

Laurels are the **first fungible reputation tokens on Ethereum that are NOT exchangeable with money or other external tokens**. They are earned by completing volunteer tasks and are voted on by other volunteers.

A video demonstrating how The Laurel is being bootstrapped with its own technology has been posted on the Ethereum Reddit channel on July 17th, 13:00 UTC:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/om3sld/the\_laurel\_is\_live\_and\_the\_ethereum\_dharma\_wheel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/om3sld/the_laurel_is_live_and_the_ethereum_dharma_wheel/) that contained just this video: 

&amp;#x200B;

The post has been removed by Ethereum moderators, without notice or a clear explanation, so without a chance to redeem the post.

I only saw the removal on July 18th, 07:30 UTC, commented on the post and I sent the mods two messages through their private communications channel. One of them being:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why was this post removed?[https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/om3sld/the\_laurel\_is\_live\_and\_the\_ethereum\_dharma\_wheel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/om3sld/the_laurel_is_live_and_the_ethereum_dharma_wheel/). It is a global platform for volunteers. There is no money involved. Laurels cannot be transferred and cannot be traded outside of The Laurel system.  
&gt;  
&gt; If I answer to comments, I expose myself to be downvoted without good reason. So, I answer to comments made in good faith. I did not consider the ""PONZI REPORT"" comment as made in good faith, because the video is clear about this being a platform for volunteers. I have the word Dharma in the title.  
&gt;  
&gt;And announcements about the Laurel have been made many times over.  
&gt;  
&gt;Plus, I have no time to follow on Reddit - I am developing.   
&gt;  
&gt;Should I really assume continuous bad faith from mods from now on?

No answer was given. So, on Jul 19, 11:45 UTC, I pinged all the mods on Twitter to ask them why was this post removed without an explanation: [https://twitter.com/lorecirstea/status/1417088274162757632](https://twitter.com/lorecirstea/status/1417088274162757632)

&gt;Why was this post removed [https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/om3sld/the\_laurel\_is\_live\_and\_the\_ethereum\_dharma\_wheel/](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/om3sld/the_laurel_is_live_and_the_ethereum_dharma_wheel/)  
&gt;  
&gt;and why did you not answer on Reddit on why it was removed?  
&gt;  
&gt;u/VitalikButerin u/tayvano_ u/twigwam u/evan_van_ness u/JBSchweitzer u/edmundedgar u/trent_vanepps u/abcoathup u/dmihal u/mr_ligi u/hudsonjameson

I got an answer from u/edmundedgar, the moderator who removed it: [https://twitter.com/edmundedgar/status/1417242557210259460:](https://twitter.com/edmundedgar/status/1417242557210259460:)

&gt;I removed it because it appears to be   
&gt;  
&gt;1) spam   
&gt;  
&gt;2) for a ponzi scheme  
&gt;  
&gt;I didn't answer the question about why it was removed that you posted on the thread because I didn't see it, because you posted it on a thread that had been removed

I explained that The Laurel cannot be a spam nor a pozi scheme, nor a spam for a ponzi scheme and that previous videos are proofs for how the mechanism is being designed. The Laurel is not even deployed on mainnet. It lives on Ropsten.

&amp;#x200B;

But the Ethereum moderators do not follow the minimum, respectful moderator guidelines: [https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines)

&gt;""Healthy communities allow for appropriate discussion (and appeal) of moderator actions. Appeals to your actions should be taken seriously. Moderator responses to appeals by their users should be consistent, germane to the issue raised and work through education, not punishment.""

&amp;#x200B;

The Laurel is under development. It only accepts volunteers as contributors. No money is involved. Only higher rewards, like medals of merit and tokens of reputation.

So why aren't we allowed to do good in the world using Ethereum tech? If we try: why aren't we allowed to share the fact? not even here on /r/ethereum?

I apologize. I cannot answer comments, even made in good faith. I have tried answering in the past only to be downvoted without any explanation. If you really have a good faith comment or question, you can post on Twitter: [https://twitter.com/lorecirstea/status/1417088274162757632](https://twitter.com/lorecirstea/status/1417088274162757632)",1626789565,lorecirstea,True,1,0,2021-07-20
