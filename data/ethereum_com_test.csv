Eth Miners can basically preview what is about to go on chain, front run that order, hustle the original user out of money, and even censor Data by continiously throwing data in front of said data, unless you want to pay.

There is still not a true staking solution such as super linear staking 

Eth is going to be the go to blockchains for smart contracts.  The creativity and world changing ideas seemed to have fizzled out, and tnh there is honestly no need for them.

Write a will specifying what will happen to your ETH. Include an explanation of what you have done.

Give each friend an envelope containing their seed phrase and instructions about the Gnosis Safe. Tell them not to tell anyone about the envelope. Don't tell them who other keyholders are. Ask them to open the envelope if you die and to give it back to you unopened if you live.

If you live, use your key to retrieve the funds. Get your friends to give you the unopened envelopes back.

If you die, the executors of your will have to make arrangements for the funds and appeal for the keyholders to come forward and release the funds.

This way you can only be betrayed by N/2 of your friends colluding against you, which given they don't even know each others identities is unlikely.

ethereum,"Everything's been dropping so selling anytime soon and waiting for a big drop would be best in my opinion. I sold my doge to get out of RH weeks ago at .245 and waited waited and got some for 17 cents and 19 cents. I waited to long to sell my ETH I couldve sold at like 2400 and I waited thinking I could get 2500 and then it was 2200 and then 2000 and 1800. Finally it jumped back to almost 2100 and I sold got back in around 1850 so don't wait until it's too late is what I'm saying

Edit: I also sold my bitcoin in like February and put it on ETH and doge. Looking at the percent gains and losses bitcoin was actually the worst out of the 3 on RH so I figured I should be in those ones instead",1626957877,2021-07-22
